      "There are questions over capability of flood defences and how money is being spent Last modified on Mon 17 Feb 2020 22.54 GMT Storm Dennis is believed to have caused the worst winter floods in recent times, in part because the rain was so widespread but also because it has fallen on ground already saturated from Storm Ciara the previous week. Storm Dennis affected huge swaths of Britain, from the Scottish Highlands to the Cornish coast and large parts of Wales and Northern Ireland. It triggered a record breaking number of Environment Agency flood warnings and alerts in England on Sunday. The Environment Agency says its flood defences – both permanent and temporary measures – are working. It says that as many as 20,000 properties have been protected from storms Ciara and Dennis due to these measures. However, Britain has experienced an exceptionally wet winter and many rural areas, including towns and villages, have been left vulnerable to the higher river levels and saturated ground. Also, physical flood structures are only one part of the armoury. Flood barriers are a small but important part of the protection from devastating storms. Experts say that while Britain can never be fully flood proof, much more could be done to better protect those in vulnerable areas. One way is to have a robust planning policy that keeps new housing developments out of flood plains. Another is natural flood management, such as planting trees, building “leaky dams” and water storage facilities. These all help slow the flow of water downstream and would take the edge off severe storms , said Prof Hannah Cloke, of the University of Reading. Prof Robert Wilby, of Loughborough University, said natural flood management would help mitigate small floods but would be overwhelmed by the likes of Ciara and Dennis. Another important tool is forecasting: the Met Office’s new £1.2bn supercomputer could be a game changer in predicting the areas most at risk of flooding. Experts say more energy should be devoted to contingency planning, local resilience measures and regular maintenance of flood defences and drainage systems. The government says it invests in areas of the highest priority. Critics say this often means protecting urban areas or properties of high commercial value, at the expense of rural communities, farms and villages. One problem is the fluctuating amount of money set aside for flood prevention each year, which means agencies cannot plan too far ahead or invest in radical changes to the landscape. In early 2019, the Environment Agency said at least £1bn a year was needed to tackle flooding and coastal erosion – more than the £600m £800m a year that has been spent since 2010. Boris Johnson’s government has committed to spending £4bn on the issue over the next five years but experts argue that a more ambitious programme needs to be implemented, looking at a broader range of defence mechanisms. “Hard flood defences are just a tiny part of what we should be doing,” said Cloke. “There’s no realistic way we can manage future flooding with hard flood defences – we really need to be thinking more than that.” The recent floods have been so widespread and damaging because the ground across Britain is saturated. It has been an exceptionally wet winter so far with autumn rainfall records being broken for South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. England as a whole had its fifth wettest autumn on record. Why? In large part, this is due to the climate emergency. Evidence from the Met Office shows the number of winter storms has increased in the north Atlantic and that they are getting stronger. Heavy rainfall events are also becoming more frequent: warmer air carries more moisture, which means rain falls in heavier showers.\n",

      "This video can not be played Major incidents have been declared in south Wales and parts of England, as Storm Dennis batters the UK. South Wales Police has been dealing with multiple landslides and floods   some trapping residents. Homes have also been flooded, while police in Worcestershire are searching for a person who is feared to have been swept into the River Teme. More than 700 flood warnings and alerts are in place across the UK, as of 23:45 GMT on Sunday. There are currently eight severe flood warnings in England, which mean there is a danger to life. A record number of flood warnings and alerts were issued for England on Sunday, according to John Curtin, the Environment Agency head of floods and coastal management   reaching a combined total of 624 by Sunday night. He said the saturated ground conditions left by last weekend Storm Ciara has driven the severe flooding seen across the UK over the past 24 hours. 24 hour accumulated rainfall levels #StormDennis   high figures but not exceptional   shows how the saturated ground conditions left by #StormCiara have driven the wide spread significant flooding weâre seeing pic.twitter.com/bjqxm3OfCh Heavy rainfall has caused multiple floods and landslides, according to South Wales Police. Dramatic video footage emerged of a landslide tearing down a mountain in Tylorstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf, south Wales, on Sunday morning. This video can not be played Jessica Falk Perlman, who is on holiday with her family in Crickhowell, Powys, to celebrate her mother 60th birthday, told BBC Radio 5 Live that firefighters woke them at 04:00 GMT to tell them they were being evacuated because the River Usk had burst its banks. But water quickly came flooding into their holiday home, forcing them upstairs and stalling their evacuation. The door of our house burst open and water came flooding in right up to the top of the stairs which was quite nerve wracking at the time, she said. It well over the front door of the house, it flooded all the way up to the ceiling. This video can not be played Amy Price, 20, said her family were trapped in the upstairs of their home in Llanover, Monmouthshire, because water on the ground floor had reached as high as the light switches. The river started rising about 1am and at 3am it started coming into the house, she said. We started sweeping the water away and then at 6am the river started coming over the bank. South Wales Police said emergency services were working with local organisations to ensure the safety of people in communities cut off by flooding, and to minimise damage and disruption. Emergency centres have been set up for those who have been displaced. Assistant chief constable Jennifer Gilmer praised rescue workers' professionalism and advised people not to panic. This video can not be played A man body was recovered from the River Tawe near Trebanos in the Swansea Valley but Dyfed Powys Police later said his death was not linked to the extreme weather. It is not being treated as suspicious. West Mercia Police said a man had been rescued from the River Teme close to Eastham Bridge, Worcestershire, and taken to hospital by ambulance but that a woman was still missing. The search for the woman has been called off until Monday. Meanwhile, in Herefordshire, the council said it was working with the emergency services, the Environment Agency and health partners to assist residents. It urged people to avoid unnecessary travel and check on their neighbours, and said rest centres are being set up for those who need to be evacuated. Sarah Bridge, 55, compared Storm Dennis to a tornado and said water had flooded her home in Pontrilas in Herefordshire despite specialist flood doors, reaching her knees.  It heartbreaking, she said. The kitchen is completely flooded, I can hear things floating about downstairs. A major incident has also been declared after flooding at properties in Lowdham in Nottinghamshire. Properties were also flooded in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire   and residents were urged to take extreme care by the area Environment Agency manager. A major incident has been declared by police following flooding in Shropshire.  â ï ̧#Shropshire Flood update: Major incident declared. Emergency services & partners are working together.ð«Many roads remain closed. Only travel if absolutelynecessary. Ludlow is most seriously affected at this time and teams are in the area. #StormDennis. Severe flood warnings, posing a danger to life, are in place at the Teme river in Ludlow, Shropshire. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News Sophy Ridge that the UK government was stepping up its response to extreme weather conditions. He said it had put Â£2.4bn into defences over a six year spending period up until next year, and would allocate Â£4bn for the next six year period. New Environment Secretary George Eustice denied that the government had been caught off guard by the floods caused by Storm Dennis. He told Sky News: We'll never be able to protect every single household just because of the nature of climate change and the fact that these weather events are becoming more extreme, but we've done everything that we can do with a significant sum of money, and there more to come. Of the flood warnings, more than 200 apply in England, more than 20 in Wales, and more than 10 in Scotland   where two people had to be rescued after their car was swept off the road near Newcastleton. In Scotland, the Forth and Tay road bridges have been closed to all traffic. Winds battered most of Scotland on Sunday with a Met Office warning in place until 11am on Monday. In York, the Environment Agency has predicted the River Ouse could come close to record levels seen in 2000.  Serious flood situation in Tenbury Wells #worcestershire this morning.

About 170 flights were cancelled on Sunday morning, affecting at least 25,000 passengers.  Storm Dennis caused disruption for 19 train companies, according to National Rail, with routes suspended across south Wales and in parts of England and Scotland. Highways England said strong winds had closed part of the M48 Severn Bridge eastbound, while flooding closed part of the M54 and A roads in Lincolnshire, Herefordshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Gloucestershire. Amber warnings for rain and yellow warnings for wind are in place for most of the country into Sunday evening. This means flooding could cause a danger to life, power cuts are expected and there is a good chance transport links will continue to be impacted. Wind gusts reached 91mph on Saturday, according to the Met Office. Also on Saturday: Last weekend Storm Ciara brought as much as 184mm of rain and gusts reaching 97mph. It also caused hundreds of homes to be flooded and left more than 500,000 people without power.

      "By Agustinus Beo Da Costa, Stanley Widianto 4 Min Read JAKARTA    Tens of thousands of people were evacuated in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta on Thursday after flash floods and landslides killed up to 26 people amid some of the heaviest rain in more than 20 years, with more deluges forecast, authorities said. The flooding, among the deadliest in years, caused chaos in parts of Southeast Asia’s biggest city with train lines blocked and power outages in some areas. Swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns were inundated after heavy rain fell on Dec. 31 and into the early hours of New Year’s Day. Social affairs ministry data showed 26 people were killed in the flooding, up from the earlier toll of 21. As of Thursday morning, over 62,000 people were evacuated in Jakarta alone, disaster mitigation agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said, although later in the day he told news channel Metro TV the number of evacuees were down to around 35,000 people. Rainfall at an airport in East Jakarta measured at 377 millimeters  early on Jan. 1, the highest daily reading during major floods since at least 1996, according to the Meteorology, Clilmatology and Geophysics Agency . Umar Dani, 52, and his family were evacuated overnight from his home in East Jakarta on a rubber boat after water levels rose up to his neck. “It has not flooded for so long here. We didn’t have the chance to bring anything,” he said. “I have to live on the streets now.” President Joko Widodo told reporters evacuation and safety measures should be prioritized and called for more coordination between city administrations and the central government. On his Twitter page, Widodo blamed delays in flood control infrastructure projects for the flooding. He said some projects have been delayed since 2017 due to land acquisition problems. “EXTREME WEATHER” EXPECTED Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan said authorities deployed hundreds of pumps to suck water from residential areas across the capital, which had allowed some people to return home. “They want to return home immediately and start cleaning up their houses as soon as they are able to enter their houses as water recedes,” Baswedan told reporters during a visit to a densely populated area in East Jakarta affected by the flood. Residents waddled through murky water to see the governor while workers pumped water out of the area into a nearby river. The mitigation agency said on its Twitter page that water levels have come down in a few affected areas, showing pictures of streets covered by mud and littered with debris. Authorities however warned people to remain vigilant as “extreme weather” is expected to continue until Jan. 7. Dwikorita Karnawati, head of the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics Agency , told reporters separately that heavy rainfall may continue until mid February. Television footage on Thursday showed rescuers in the nearby city of Tangerang evacuating residents, guiding them across a strong current by holding on to a rope. Jakarta and its surroundings are home to more than 30 million people. More than 50 people died in one of the capital’s deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the centre of the city was inundated after canals overflowed. The government announced last year that it is relocating the capital to East Kalimantan province on Borneo, though the planning ministry pledged that the government will invest $40 billion in modernizing Jakarta.

      "Homes along the River Severn in Shropshire have been evacuated, amid fears that flood barriers could be breached in the coming hours. Houses and a pub near Ironbridge have been submerged by rising waters and the pressure has cracked road surfaces. Around the UK, more than 150 flood warnings remain in place, including six severe   or danger to life   warnings. The River Wye at Monmouth, in Wales, has reached its highest recorded level. Among the worst affected areas are south Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire, where major incidents have been declared. West Mercia Police said an estimated 384 properties have been significantly impacted by flooding in Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. Water levels are expected to rise in Bewdley, Worcestershire, and there are concerns it could flow around one of the local flood barriers at Beales Corner. Currently, there are six severe flood warnings in England, covering the rivers Lugg, Severn, and Wye. More rain is expected in parts of the UK later this week, with three yellow Met Office weather warnings issued for north and south Wales and north west England for Wednesday evening. The latest severe flood warning   for the River Severn in Telford, Shropshire   prompted the evacuation of homes in Ironbridge on Tuesday morning. River levels are peaking late on Tuesday, according to the latest update from Telford and Wrekin Council. ***Ironbridge flooding update, 18 February 2020, at 8pm*** River levels are peaking tonight.

Practically just the roof showing there now, she said. A care home and surrounding properties in Whitchurch, Herefordshire, were also evacuated after they were overcome by floods, local fire services said.  Meanwhile, Welsh Water has warned drinking water is running out in Monmouth and surrounding areas after unprecedented flooding at its treatment works in Mayhill. There was some relief in Upton upon Severn, Worcestershire, on Monday as defences appeared not to have been breached overnight, but severe flood warnings for the area now predict river levels will peak by Wednesday.

He told BBC News: We were told when they built that flood defence that if it had been there before 2007, we wouldn't have been flooded.  Although there have been a couple of near misses over the past few years, we were still confident that we wouldn't get flooded again.

The council added that the river flood peak was moving towards the Ironbridge Gorge and was expected to arrive there later on Tuesday, while the Environment Agency warned flooding in the Wharfage is potentially imminent.  It comes as the River Wye at Monmouth, south Wales, peaked at 7.15m high on Tuesday, breaking the previous record high of 6.48m in 2002. There are two severe warnings in place on the River Wye at Monmouth, according to Natural Resources Wales. Around 800 homes in Wales have been directly affected by flooding, First Minister Mark Drakeford told the BBC. The Welsh government has put aside between Â£5m and Â£10m to help those residents affected. Meanwhile, the key developments in England are: People in flood hit households can apply for financial hardship payments of up to Â£500 for short term relief, the government announced on Tuesday. Local Government Secretary RobertÂ Jenrick said the funding would help people in the worst hit areas to recover and get back on their feet. The government support fund also includes up to Â£5,000 for affected residents and business owners to help make their properties more resilient to future floods.

      "Even if you don't live in an area prone to flooding, you may want to consider taking out a policy After heavy rains caused the breach of two dams in central Michigan last month, thousands of residents around the overflowing Tittabawassee River and adjoining lakes saw their homes and communities inundated, and destroyed, by floodwaters. Now, news reports say, many face rebuilding with little financial help. Their homeowners insurance won’t pay for most of the flood damage; that’s what flood insurance is for. But because the Michigan homeowners weren’t living in an area known to be flood prone, most didn’t have that coverage. If you don't have flood insurance and you’re hit by a flood, the damage can be costly, says Lizzie Litzow, a spokesperson for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster and can happen anywhere,“ Litzow says. “Just 1 inch of water can cause up to $25,000 in damage to a home or apartment.” Most homeowners pay less than $400 per year for flood coverage in low  to moderate risk areas, FEMA says.  The National Flood Insurance Program , administered by FEMA, provides the bulk of residential flood coverage in the U.S. Though the insurance is underwritten by the federal government, it can be purchased through most insurance agents who sell homeowners insurance. If you’re considering buying flood insurance, here’s a rundown of what is—and isn’t—covered, according to FEMA. Keep in mind that it takes 30 days to kick in after you purchase the policy. Essential systems in the home. This includes electrical and plumbing systems, furnaces, water heaters, central air conditioners, heat pumps, and sump pumps. It also includes cisterns and the water in them, fuel tanks and the fuel in them, solar energy equipment, water tanks, and pumps. Appliances. Refrigerators, ranges, and built in appliances, such as dishwashers, washing machines, and dryers, are usually covered. So, too, are portable window air conditioners, and freezers and the food in them. Carpeting and window treatments. If you have permanently installed carpeting over an unfinished floor, or any other kind of carpets over wooden floors, your policy should cover them. Your policy should also include window blinds and curtains. Permanently installed paneling, wallboard, bookcases, and cabinets. If you have to replace your cabinets, your policy will pay only for the ones that were damaged. If some cabinets were ruined but others were not affected, you might have trouble getting cabinets that match the older ones. Foundation walls, anchorage systems, and staircases attached to the building. There is an exclusion for “loss caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood.” A detached garage, used for limited storage or parking. You can use up to 10 percent of your total building coverage toward your garage, but that amount will be subtracted from the total amount of building coverage available to you. Personal property. This includes clothing, furniture, and electronic equipment—though only if they’re not stored in the basement.   Certain valuables. Your policy is likely to cover items such as original artwork and furs, up to $2,500 in value. Other coverage. Some events are covered even if they’re not strictly floods, such as groundwater seepage and mudflow. These would include a neighbor’s above ground swimming pool collapsing, causing the water to flow into your home, or a water main break that damages your home and at least one other in your neighborhood. However, damage caused by a sewer backup is covered only if it’s a direct result of flooding. Flood insurance has eligibility requirements and numerous exclusions. According to the NFIP, the following kinds of damage are not covered by flood insurance: Federal flood insurance coverage is also capped at $250,000 per building and $100,000 for contents, though you can purchase policies with lower limits. There are separate deductibles for your dwelling and contents. Higher coverage limits are available for policies for nonresidential structures and their contents. Get more details from FEMA. You can buy national flood insurance issued by the NFIP through thousands of insurance agents nationwide. Check with an agent who sells homeowners or renters coverage for details. If your insurance agent does not sell flood insurance, you can contact the NFIP Help Center, at 800 427 4661. People who live in low  and moderate risk areas and buy federal flood insurance pay standard premiums set by FEMA. These rates are the same regardless of where you buy your coverage. To get an estimate of your annual premium and a link to agents who sell federal flood insurance, go to the FEMA Flood Map Service Center and enter your property address in the search bar. This will take you to the official flood insurance rate map for your area. To find a provider of flood insurance to your area, use the search tool at the NFIP’s website, FloodSmart. You can also check My Flood Quote, a commercial site, to see your property on a flood map and get detailed estimates of premiums. If you’re in a high risk area, your premium is likely to be tailored to your property. According to FEMA, there are many variables that go into the pricing, including the age and construction of the home, its proximity to water, the elevation of the house, and the home’s value. Renters, too, can get flood insurance. That may be particularly worthwhile if you live in a first floor or below ground apartment. As a renter, you’re entitled to buy coverage only for the contents of your apartment or house. You’re entitled to the same maximum coverage limit on the same items as homeowners: $100,000 for your home’s contents. Consumer Reports also can help you find a homeowners insurance carrier with the best track record for claims and customer service. Increasingly, private insurers are offering flood coverage. The policies either supplement federal flood insurance by providing higher coverage limits or replace it as the homeowner’s primary flood policy. A few insurance carriers provide it as an optional rider on their homeowners coverage. Depending on your situation, you may find that private flood insurance has lower premiums than the federal version, says Craig Poulton, CEO of Poulton Associates in Salt Lake City, the underwriting manager and administrator of private flood insurer Natural Catastrophe Insurance Program. Or it may require fewer add on costs. For example, in about 20 percent of cases, the government will require that a professional come to the home to draft an “elevation certificate” to determine the insurance rate. The homeowner pays that bill. In addition, private coverage may cover your living expenses if you have to relocate while your home is being cleaned up after a flood. That’s something federal flood insurance doesn’t provide.

      "By Zarir Hussain, Gopal Sharma 3 Min Read GUWAHATI, India/KATHMANDU, Nepal    Nearly four million people in India’s northeastern state of Assam and neighbouring Nepal have been displaced by heavy flooding from monsoon rains, with dozens missing as deaths rose to at least 189, government officials said on Sunday. The overflowing Brahmaputra River, which flows through China’s Tibet, India and Bangladesh, has damaged crops and triggered mudslides, displacing millions of people, officials said. More than 2.75 million people in Assam have been displaced by three waves of floods since late May that has claimed 79 lives after two more deaths were reported overnight, a state government official said. “The flood situation remains critical with most of the rivers flowing menacingly above the danger mark,” Assam water resources Minister Keshab Mahanta told Reuters. Assam is facing the twin challenge of combating floods and the coronavirus pandemic. Out of 33 districts, 25 remained affected after the current wave of flooding, beginning a fortnight ago. India is grappling with the novel coronavirus, which has infected nearly 1.1 million people and 26,816 have died from the COVID 19 disease, government data showed on Sunday. In neighbouring Nepal, the government asked residents along its southern plains on Sunday to remain alert as heavy monsoon rains were expected to pound the Himalayan nation where more than 100 have died in floods and landslides since June, officials said. Some 110 people were killed and another 100 injured as landslides and flash floods washed or swept away homes, upended roads and bridges and displaced hundreds of others in 26 of the country’s 77 districts, police said. Home ministry official Murari Wasti said the death toll was expected to rise as 48 people were still missing. “Search and rescue teams are looking for those who are missing in different places but chances of finding them alive are slim,” Wasti told Reuters. Barun Paudel of the weather forecasting office in the capital, Kathmandu, said heavy rains were expected to pound much of the mainly mountainous nation in the next four days. “We have urged residents to remain alert against possible landslides and floods,” he said. Landslides and flash floods are common in Nepal, India’s Assam and Bihar states during the June September annual rainy season.

      "Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has declared a state of emergency. Michigan governor completes aerial tour of flood damage The governor of Michigan declared a state of emergency Tuesday night after rapidly rising waters crashed through two dams and forced thousands to evacuate. Officials with the city of Midland warned residents that the Edenville Dam, along the Tittabawassee River, failed around 5:45 p.m., and that the Sandord Dam began to overflow around 6:50 p.m. Since Monday, storms have produced more than 8 inches of rain that overflowed the dams and caused downstream flooding in Midland County. Sea Cord and Smallwood dams were experiencing high water flow on Wednesday and being closely monitored. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said at a press conference on Wednesday that damage to the dams has been a known problem for a while. This incredible damage requires that we hold people responsible, and we are pursuing every line of legal recourse that we can, Whitmer added. Midland City Manager Brad Kaye said flood heights are expected to be up to 5 feet higher than the last major flood, in 1986. In the 1986 flood, it was considered a 100 year flood, Kaye said. Current flood is predicted to be the equivalent of a 500 year flood. A 500 year flood means there a 0.002% chance    1 in 500    of it occurring in a given year, according to the United States Geological Survey. Whitmer said on Wednesday that waters may be at their highest around 8 p.m. We do know that the water is continuing to rise, allbeit at a slower pace, but that why we have got to continue to take this seriously, she added. The National Weather Service on Tuesday evening urged anyone near the river to seek higher ground following castastrophic dam failures at the Edenville Dam, which is about 140 miles north of Detroit, and the Sanford Dam, the Associated Press reported. About 130 members of the Michigan National Guard were deployed early Wednesday to help evacuate citizens and assist emergency planners with logistics. Midland County has over 83,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census. Shelter locations are in Colman High School, Bullet Creek, Midland High School, North Midland Family Center and West Midland Family Center, said Midland County Board Chair Mark Bone. President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday that his team is closely monitoring the floods and that FEMA would be assisting. Kaye said local water systems are potentially at risk, and hospitals are major concern. However, MidMichigan Medical Center Midland said the facility isn't planning to evacuate just yet. We have been working alongside local agencies, watching closely the rapid changes that have been occurring due to the flooding, the hospital said in a statement. We have transferred a few patients that were identified by their physician. ... We continue to monitor the situation as it evolves.

      "Historic Michigan flood destroys Sanford SANFORD, MI    While the flood waters have subsided enough for most Sanford residents to return to their homes and businesses, many are realizing the worst isn’t over yet. After experiencing heavy rainfall May 17 18, Midland County’s Sanford and Edenville Dams began showing signs of damage. By Tuesday, May 19, the Edenville Dam collapsed, and the Sanford Dam became structurally unsound. Soon after, Sanford and Wixom Lakes began to flood. Wixom Lake was entirely dried out by Wednesday, May 20, and Sanford Lake continued to drain throughout the remainder of the week. Much of that water made its way to Sanford. “We were devastated”  Some Sanford residents and business owners began the trek back home Thursday, May 21, after enough roads reopened for them to safely return. Like many of her neighbors, Connie Methner was eager, but not optimistic, to see what was left of her shop. Methner has lived in Sanford for 35 years. Around 34 years of that has been dedicated to her business, CJ’s Hairstyling. She first bought her shop, located at 309 W. Saginaw Road, in the aftermath of what’s known locally as the Great Flood of 1986, which had set Midland County’s previous record flood level at 33.9 feet. This week’s flood toppled that record in Midland at 35.05 feet. “We had a 100 year flood in ’86, and I bought  knowing that  never came up to here,” she said. “Then, in 2017, we had another flood, and again it never came up to here.” Unfortunately, Methner couldn’t pull off a hat trick. When she and her husband waded their way back to CJ’s on Thursday, she found out that the flood waters had completely engulfed the shop. The water had gone all the way up to the shop’s ceilings, rendering the building beyond repair. “We were devastated by the floods of two dams,” Methner said as she sat inside what’s left of CJ’s. “Wixom Lake came down on top of Sanford Lake and totally wiped us out. It’s kind of hard – 34 years of my life has gone, except that I still have some terrific clients, some terrific memories.” Like Methner, lifelong Sanford residents Mary and Dennis Schnettler never anticipated flooding would affect their home. The Schnettlers lived in Sanford during the 1986 floods, which Mary said ‘isn’t even close” to the devastation the recent flooding events have had on Sanford. The Schnettlers’ home survived the recent flood, but they lost most of their possessions. Mary said she still knows they fared better than many of their neighbors. “It’s unreal    it’s like a dream,” she said. Surveying the damage As the Schnettlers stood hand in hand on a bridge overlooking the damage, Dennis laughed as he remembered how happy he was when the bridge was first paved years ago. “It was old, broken up concrete, and it’s back to that now,” he said. “The town has grown, been a good place to raise our family.” The Schnettlers raised two children in their Sanford home, one who now lives in Midland, and another who moved to Houston. Mary said she had talked to her daughter out of state, who kept “crying, crying, crying,” wishing to be in Sanford to help her parents. Despite the devastation, though, Mary said she is still thankful their home survived. “We’re fortunate. We still have our house,” she said. “To come down here and to see all this, I’m amazed at the power of that water and what it did.” While the Schenttlers surveyed the damaged on a bridge near their home, Methner and her husband remained at CJ’s, salvaging what they could of the supplies and trinkets Methner kept around the shop. Not much survived, but Methner was able to find a few photos she had hung on the walls. “I was lucky enough to find my kids’ senior pictures, she said. “I always kept them on the wall, and they survived. Three baby pictures of my kids when there were two months old that I don’t have anywhere else survived.” Tapping on the desk next to her, Methner rattled off a list of losses: various supplies such as scissors, mirrors and furniture, to name a few. Among the damaged furniture was the desk sitting next to her. “This was my desk. This was the top of my desk, and that’s what people wrote checks on, she said. “It’s warped. The only thing it didn’t warp I think is this divider my husband built me that we kept our product lines on. I can’t believe that made it.” Financial burdens of rebuilding Despite the “total destruction” of CJ’s, Methner hopes to rebuild it. Now, though, she remains unsure how she will afford that undertaking. Sanford is a small village with only 859 people reported on the town’s 2010 census. Many residents rely on credit from local businesses and live paycheck to paycheck, Methner said. On top of that, those deemed unessential during the coronavirus pandemic have been out of work for around two months. “I’ve been shut down for two months with the possible of more because I’m a hair dresser, Methner said. “That’s two months of no work, and now no building.” Methner understood why her business had to close during the pandemic and said she agrees that safety should be a first priority. While waiting to reopen, Methner hired someone to help her clean the shop and prepare it for social distancing and other safety protocols. “We came in and polished it, got it organized and took out furniture – thank God, because it would be gone,” she said. We opened it up so it would be 6 feet safe. It was sparkling, it was perfect and now it’s gone. I wish I took pictures.” Besides being closed for two months amid a pandemic, Methner said she was never offered flood insurance when she first opened her doors. Sanford was not deemed a flood risk area, she said she was told, so CJ’s and, other local businesses and residents, do not have flood insurance. “I’m going to try to come back. I’m going to try to put another shop in here, Methner said. But we have no insurance that will cover it. It’s not just me    it’s everybody in this town, every home. Now, who has this money?” Methner and the Schnettlers hope the Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide financial relief to residents and businesses. Otherwise, Mary is unsure how many Sanford residents will survive. “We’ve been devastated. It’s going to take years for us to recover from this, Mary said. No words can really describe what we’re feeling.” “We hope they support us, Dennis added. If you don’t live here, and it doesn’t affect you, you can kind of blow it off. You have to be here to see it, to live it.” An uncertain future Methner and the Schnettlers aren’t sure what the future will look like for Sanford. While President Trump approved an emergency declaration for areas affected by the flood, Methner is frustrated by the focus for much of the relief seems to be on Midland. “I know that Midland got it, don’t get me wrong,” she said. It’s all about Midland. But this is a whole flipping town, and Midland didn’t all get gone. It’s a whole town destroyed by this, not just one or two. All of my fellow business owners in this town plus family and residents all through here have been wiped out.” As Sanford waits for federal and state aid come to the region, Methner noted that everyone is acting like “walking zombies, unable to comprehend how such devastation could have happened to them. “We’re in the Twilight Zone. We are truly in the Twilight Zone, she said. “You can’t make this up outside of movie theaters. You see it in the movies, but we lived it.” Mary expressed a similar feeling of disbelief and shock. While she tries to remain optimistic that help will come, she, too, has her doubts about the future. “It still hasn’t hit me yet. It’s hard, it’s very hard, she said. And you don’t know the future, either. Will we have one? We don’t even know.” Read More  Midland community pulls together as floodwaters recede, recovery begins President Trump approves emergency declaration in wake of mid Michigan flooding Midland announces sewage issues for some residents and guidelines for returning home It doesn’t look good, but Sanford Dam is actually still standing with some of berm washed away Saginaw River reaches peak in Bay City without major flooding issues Failed dam owner fought with state over Wixom Lake levels before flood Flooding in Michigan: Everything we know about Midland County dam break Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.\n",

      " Bangladesh + 2 moreKuala Lumpur/Delhi/Dhaka/Kathmandu//Geneva, 22 July 2020 – A humanitarian crisis is deepening in South Asia as new figures reveal that more than 9.6 million people have been affected by monsoon floods, devastating large areas of India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  said: “Millions of people across Bangladesh, India and Nepal have been marooned, their homes damaged and crops destroyed by floods that are the worst in recent years. “Every year there are monsoon floods, but this year is different as it comes at the height of a deadly COVID 19 global pandemic. Tragically, already 550 people have lost their lives and more than 9.6 million people have been swamped across South Asia.” Close to one third of Bangladesh has already been flooded with forecasts of worse flooding in the coming days. More than 2.8 million people have been affected, including over 1 million who remain isolated and surrounded by floodwaters, according to the Bangladesh Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. In India, more than 6.8 million people have been affected by severe floods, mainly in the northern states of Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Meghalaya bordering Bangladesh, according to the Indian National Emergency Response Centre. In Nepal, flooding and landslides have already killed close to 110 people. Across India, Bangladesh and Nepal, 550 have died according to government figures. Millions have been displaced from their homes. Mr Chapagain said: “People in Bangladesh, India and Nepal are sandwiched in a triple disaster of flooding, the coronavirus and an associated socioeconomic crisis of loss of livelihoods and jobs. Flooding of farm lands and destruction of crops can push millions of people, already badly impacted by the COVID 19, further into poverty.” IFRC has released more than 800,000 Swiss francs  to support Bangladesh Red Crescent relief activities, including more than 230,000 Swiss francs released last month when flood forecasts signalled the extent of the potential impact. Volunteers in India, Bangladesh and Nepal are helping with shelter, providing tarpaulins, dry food and hygiene kits, and installing pumps for safe water. In Bangladesh, Red Crescent teams have distributed cash grants to help more than 35,000 people cope with the flooding. In India, over 9,200 tarpaulins have been distributed to most at risk families. In Nepal, Red Cross teams are airlifting relief supplies to communities that cannot be reached by road. Many communities in Bangladesh and India are still recovering after Cyclone Amphan damaged or destroyed more than 260,000 homes, crops and infrastructure, two months ago.

      "JACKSON, Miss. – Weeks of heavy rain have inundated a large portion of the southern U.S., bringing near record flooding to portions of Mississippi and Tennessee.  In Jackson, Mississippi, hundreds of residents either watched their homes flood over the weekend or worried their residence would soon be drenched as the Pearl River crested Monday at 36.8 feet, its third highest level ever recorded – behind only 1979 and 1983. Calling the Jackson floods historic and unprecedented, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said in a Sunday press conference that we do not anticipate this situation to end anytime soon. It will be days before we are out of the woods and the waters recede. Reeves said at a news conference Monday that there were no reports of flood related injuries and thanked the people of Mississippi for heeding evacuation orders. Only 16 search and rescue missions were necessary, he said, even though as many as 1,000 homes were flooded.  The governor also warned the hundreds of evacuees in the Jackson area not to rush back home until they got the all clear. Reeves had declared a state of emergency Saturday because of the floods. The flooding is the result of a stubbornly damp weather pattern: February has seen a constant stream of wet storms rolling across the Deep South, said AccuWeather meteorologist Paul Walker, who called it a crazy month for the amount of rain that fallen across the region. More wet weather is on the way: Rain showers were forecast to develop Monday night over the Mississippi River Valley, further saturating an already soggy South, the Weather Channel said. The National Weather Service said that this entire area is quite soaked and any additional rainfall may lead to more runoff issues and additional flooding. Residents began filling sandbags and preparing their homes, businesses and churches for the flooding last week after multiple days of heavy rain, AccuWeather said. Jackson resident Mark Wakefield knows what it takes to rebuild after flooding: His in laws’ home in Jackson has flooded four times before. The worst was 1979 when the house was 8 feet underwater. The home has flooded again, he said, and this time they might not come back. “It’s no fun,” Wakefield said. “Once the water’s in the house we’re looking at months of cleanup and reconstruction. It’s nothing life threatening to us, we’re careful enough ... but it’s just extremely frustrating and disgusting to have to go through this.” Nearly 2,400 structures across the three Mississippi counties closest to the Pearl River and its Barnett Reservoir – Hinds, Rankin and Madison – could get water indoors or be surrounded by floods, said Malary White of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. While the focus now is on the Jackson area, the heavy rains and flooding have affected a much larger swath of the state. State emergency management officials said they had received preliminary damage reports from 11 counties connected with the severe weather that hit the state starting Feb. 10. In Tennessee, February’s rains have been “400% of normal, and we have more coming in this week, Tennessee Valley Authority spokesman Jim Hopson said. It’s kind of a never ending battle.   “Mother Nature is really the one in charge – we simply try to manage what Mother Nature gives us to minimize the impacts along the 652 mile Tennessee River and its thousands of miles of tributaries and streams,” he said. The southern flooding could be a precursor to another disastrous year for flooding, especially in the central U.S. In fact, there are troubling signs spring 2020 could bring a repeat of widespread flooding in the nation midsection somewhat reminiscent of last year massive event, the Weather Channel warned. Long range flood forecasts issued last week by the National Weather Service said there is an above average chance of widespread flooding this spring along stretches of the Mississippi River, Missouri River, Red River and other tributaries in the northern and central U.S. Flooding last year in the Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas River basins were responsible for 12 deaths and an estimated $20 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

      "By David Stanway 4 Min Read SHANGHAI    As China counts the costs of its most punishing flood season in more than three decades, the role played by the massive and controversial Three Gorges Dam   designed to help tame the Yangtze river   has come under fresh scrutiny. Amid some of the heaviest rainfall on record, the Chinese government says the world’s biggest hydroelectric plant has reduced flood peaks, minimised economic losses and slashed the number of deaths and emergency evacuations. But critics say the historically high water levels on the Yangtze and its major lakes prove the Three Gorges Dam isn’t doing what it was designed for. “One of the major justifications for the Three Gorges Dam was flood control, but less than 20 years after its completion we have the highest floodwater in recorded history,” said David Shankman, a geographer with the University of Alabama who studies Chinese floods. “The fact is that it cannot prevent these severe events.” Ye Jianchun, China’s vice minister of water resources, said at a Monday briefing the “detailed scheduling” of water discharges from reservoirs, particularly the Three Gorges, had been effective in controlling floods this year. He said 64.7 billion cubic metres of floodwater has been stored in 2,297 reservoirs, including 2.9 billion cubic metres at Three Gorges. The company running the Three Gorges Project also said on Saturday that downstream water discharges had been halved since July 6, “effectively reducing the speed and extent of water level rises on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze”. The total amount of stored floodwater had now reached 88% of the reservoir’s total capacity, it added. But parts of the Yangtze, its tributaries and major lakes like the Dongting and Poyang have hit record levels anyway. Fan Xiao, a Chinese geologist and long standing critic of giant dam projects, said the storage capacity at Three Gorges amounts to less than 9% of average floodwater. “It can only partially and temporarily intercept the upstream floods, and is powerless to help with floods caused by heavy rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,” he said. Fan said Three Gorges and other major dam projects could even make flooding worse by altering the flow of sedimentation down the Yangtze. The project’s need to generate electricity has also undermined flood control, he said. “When people only consider using reservoirs to solve flood control problems, they often overlook or even weaken the natural ability of rivers and their lakes to regulate floods,” he said. Shankman said that the Three Gorges Dam helps alleviate flooding during normal years, but that it was always likely to be vulnerable to more extreme weather, a problem that is exacerbated by shrinking flood plains downstream. “The Three Gorges Dam reservoir does not have the capacity to significantly affect the most severe floods,” he said. “Floodwater storage along the middle Yangtze is less because of stronger levees that are less likely to fail,” he added. “Both of those things are at play here. This was predictable.” Reporting by David Stanway. Editing by Gerry Doyle Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "The Bureau of Meteorology  has warned dangerous conditions will continue into Monday, with life threatening flash flooding and damaging winds persisting overnight.   The affected areas include the Hunter, Central Coast, Sydney metropolitan area, Illawarra and eastern parts of the Central Tablelands, including the Blue Mountains.  The NSW State Emergency Service  has issued two flood evacuation orders and an evacuation warning for areas at risk on Sunday night.  Residents around Narrabeen Lagoon in Sydney northern beaches were told to evacuate by 10:30pm. The SES said the lagoon was rising quickly and, with a high tide expected at 10:45pm, residents may become trapped and conditions may be too dangerous for people to be rescued.  People have been advised to stay with family or friends, or head to evacuation centres at Mona Vale Memorial Hall or Cromer Community Centre.  Elsewhere, residents in Moorebank, Chipping Norton and Milperra were told to evacuate high danger areas towards Liverpool by 7:00pm.  The order is for all affected properties in Arthur Street, Rickard Road, Davy Robinson Drive and Newbridge Road between Milperra Bridge and Riverside Road. An evacuation centre has been set up at the Velodrome in Bass Hill. Residents in the North Richmond Lowlands area have also been told to prepare to evacuate on Saturday evening due to rising flood levels which could cut off the North Richmond Bridge evacuation route.  A severe thunderstorm warning has also been issued for the Central Tablelands, North West Slopes and Plains and Central West Slopes and Plains.  The SES said storms will bring heavy rainfall which could lead to flash flooding in areas including Tamworth, Gunnedah, Coonabarabran, Bendemeer, Tambar Springs and Dunedoo. It comes as heavy rain has been falling steadily across much of the state since Wednesday, with some of the strongest falls until Sunday seen in northern NSW, near Byron Bay and Kingscliff, which had close to 300mm fall on Saturday. Thousands were without power on Sunday afternoon as the wild weather downed powerlines.  Ausgrid said 77,000 customers were without power in Sydney, the Central Coast and the Hunter, while Endeavour Energy said 27,000 customers were without power across Western Sydney, the Blue Mountains and Illawarra.  Transport NSW warned there was extensive disruption to roads and public transport, including the closures of the Wakehurst Parkway at Narrabeen, the Windsor and Richmond bridges and the northbound lanes of South Dowling Street in Surry Hills. Bus services were replacing services including the Manly and Parramatta ferries, and Blue Mountains, South Coast lines and Central Coast and Newcastle trains where lines were closed.   Drivers and transport users are advised to check for updates.  In Sydney CBD on Sunday afternoon, five people were treated for potential neck and spine injuries after a tree fell on a car on Bridge Street.  Four passengers in their 50s were taken to St Vincent and Royal Prince Alfred hospitals in stable condition in what NSW Ambulance said was a lucky escape. NSW Ambulance Inspector Giles Buchanan said the wet, windy weather was wreaking havoc.  Please do not underestimate these conditions, they have the potential to be deadly, he said The SES said it had taken 4170 calls since midnight on Saturday, 58 of which resulted in flood rescues.  Four men were rescued on Saturday night after their boat capsized in Brisbane Water around 11:30pm. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Karen Webb said the incident showed people were not heeding warnings about the dangerous conditions. That was very reckless and unnecessary, and put lives at risk, she said. Amid the wet conditions, the NSW Rural Fire Service night said on Saturday the Currowan Fire in Shoalhaven was officially out after burning for 74 days and destroying 312 homes in towns including Lake Conjola. It burnt through 499,621 hectares. BOM forecaster Jane Golding said such prolonged and heavy rain was unusual. It is uncommon to see rainfall rates as high as we have seen, up in the hundreds of millimetres occurring over consecutive days, she said.  The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning extending the length of the coast, with torrential rainfall and damaging winds of up to 90 kilometres per hour expected. The powerful winds, rain and a king tide are expected to cause erosion along parts of the coast. Flood alerts have been issued for Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie, Taree, Newcastle, Gosford, Sydney, Katoomba, Lithgow, Wollongong, Nowra, Ulladulla, Eden and Moruya Heads. Emergency Services Minister David Elliott said people should reflect on the need to go out today. What we will see today is very dangerous driving conditions so people are encouraged not to drive through roads or across bridges that they can't see, he said. The Mid North Coast received 250mm of rain in the past 24 hours, while 150mm fell across the Blue Mountains and Central Coast.  Ms Goulding said as the system moved south, Sydney and the Central Coast should expect to see similar rainfall totals that fell across the north of the state. The last time Sydney saw as much rainfall as we have had now, that was  2016 ... but we have surpassed those figures and you have to go back as far as 1998 to see totals like we will get. Authorities say the weather system will help top up Sydney water catchments. Warragamba Dam has been at 44 per cent capacity but Water NSW said, with its catchment area set to gain 130mm of rain on Saturday, capacity could rise to 55 per cent.  It said it was set to receive its best inflows since April 2017, and could effectively recoup nine months of water supply in less than a week.  Adrian Langdon from Water NSW said farmers were also cheering with some parts of the state receiving their best rainfall in almost a decade. For some of those agricultural areas that have been extremely dry for the last three to five years,  getting some good rainfall as well. The BOM said winds would generate large, powerful rains in combination with king tides which could lead to significant coastal erosion. Massive waves were seen moving up a cliff face at Kurnell, creating what has been described as a reverse waterfall. The NSW RFS said the rain had reduced the number of fires burning across the state to 37. Mr Elliott said he was pleased fire conditions had eased, and while there was still work to be done, he didn't expect the normal bushfire season would need to be extended. Meanwhile, following Mr Elliott warning against boofhead behaviour prompted by footage of a man riding a jet ski on a flooded road in Tuggerah on the Central Coast, more antics have emerged.  A man was filmed riding a bodyboard at a drive through of a fast food restaurant, in what is believed to be the same area as the jet ski footage.

      "As global climate change begins to make a home in the United States in the form of rising seas, punishing storms, and more intense rainfall issues that are all too common in Ottawa County the federal government underestimates the flood risk for 273,127 households and properties in Ohio, a wide ranging scientific analysis released Monday found. The First Street Foundation, a nonprofit organization that combined a series of contemporary flooding models into a single, nationwide flood risk tool, estimates that 493,012 properties in the state today face a 1% annual chance of flooding. That threshold is the gold standard the federal government uses to assess which homeowners must purchase flood insurance, and local planners use to determine which areas are safe to develop. But under current federal flood maps, First Street found 219,885 properties in the floodplain, 124.2% less than in its model. Experts say that places residents and property owners at an underappreciated risk to life and property. Map: See your neighborhood flood risk today through 2030 Particularly problematic are Hamilton and Cuyahoga counties, where 19,009 and 14,735 properties are at risk of flooding but do not fall within the federal flood maps, the highest discrepancies in the state. Cincinnati and Columbus lead the way among cities, where a combined 15,852 properties face previously unidentified flooding risk. The information will give local governments and property owners a leap forward in understanding their evolving risks from climate change and other hazards, said Kerry Emanuel, a meteorology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It takes pieces of information from many experts and puts it together in a way that hasn’t been done before to give property owners “the risk of their home being blown down or flooded by salt or freshwater,” Emanuel said. “They’re going to watch the value of their property plummet over time,” he said. “That might make them think twice,” he said, adding that it might also convince them to ask their elected representatives “to do something about it.” The problem extends nationally, with a total of 14.6 million properties across the nation at risk of flooding. That’s nearly six million more than fall within current Federal Emergency Management floodplains, a 70% increase. First Street’s data, developed in coordination with dozens of flood researchers and environmental engineers, show the additional risk touches nearly every corner of America. The database will have information for “every home in the country, 145 million properties, and that’s commercial properties as well, aside from Alaska and Hawaii,” said the foundation’s president, Matthew Eby. “We’ll have the address, the FEMA zone, the building footprint , the parcel, the elevation, all the inundation statistics and a slew of different flood calculations.” Particularly at risk are the most populated states. In California, First Street calculated about 500,000 properties fall within FEMA floodplains, or about 4% of the state’s total. But First Street calculated the actual number of properties currently at risk is nearly 1.1 million, more than double the federal government’s calculations and the largest discrepancy of any state. New York and Pennsylvania follow, each with more than 370,000 additional properties at risk. But problems also touch interior states with little reputation for flooding. In Utah, First Street calculates about 113,000 properties are at risk of flooding. That’s more than a four fold increase over the 21,000 within FEMA floodplains, the largest such jump anywhere in the country. Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and Tennessee follow, each with more than three times the number of properties at risk than what federal maps show. FEMA measures the number of properties at risk in Ottawa County at 4%, while the new research by the First Street Foundation measured it at 10% in 2020. More: Lake Erie water levels on track to set record highs And the situation is getting worse. In addition to a present day analysis, First Street’s modeling incorporated 2050 projections from the International Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations’ primary scientific body on the planet’s changing climate. The conclusion: another 1.5 million properties will be at risk of going underwater in 30 years, primarily along the Gulf Coast and Mid Atlantic. In Ottawa County, the number of properties affected by flooding is projected to increase by 3.5% from 2020 to 2050.  More: Lake Erie water level woes expected to continue in 2020 Current federal flood maps offer no such future projections, amplifying the unknown risk. “There’s big areas of the country that don’t have maps at all so this will be the first time that anyone in that area has actually mapped flood risk for them because the populations are smaller,” Eby said. FEMA is mandated by Congress to do it in a certain way, he said, while First Street doesn’t face the same restrictions. The National Association of Realtors looks forward to seeing the new data, stated its president, Vince Malta. “Improving access to credible flood risk data is critical to many property owners and prospective buyers across the country and to enhancing confidence in real estate markets in various U.S. regions,” Malta said. The Association and its members, he said, “welcome all prudent steps toward the development and dissemination of resources that will help American consumers make fully informed decisions about properties’ specific flood risks.” USA TODAY data reporter Theresa Diffendal and News Herald reporter Jon Stinchcomb contributed to this report.

      "By Sangmi Cha 3 Min Read SEOUL    North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered officials to provide food and shelter for hundreds of families who lost their homes in floods, the KCNA state news agency reported on Friday. Heavy rain across the Korean peninsula has brought flooding to both North and South Korea in recent days, and concern is growing about damage to North Korean crops and its potential impact on food supplies. “It is of priority importance to quickly supply sleeping materials, daily commodities, medicines and other necessities to the flood affected people to stabilize their living,” Kim said in comments carried by KCNA. Kim made the remarks while inspecting a flood hit part of North Hwanghae Province, on the border of South Korea, as he “clarified tasks” for recovery work with officials there. Torrential rain for several days has inundated more than 730 single story houses, destroying 179 of them, and flooded rice growing land, KCNA said. There were no reports of casualties. State television footage showed Kim visiting rural areas where a flooded river devastated farmlands and the roofs of some houses had collapsed. Kim would also mobilise the army for rehabilitation, in particular work on homes and roads, and he called on architects to build 800 model houses in a badly hit farming village in Unpha County, KCNA said. The rain during the harvest season in the rice growing area is raising concern about North Korea’s food security. North Korea’s ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, cited a study that said rice and corn would suffer if the crops were under water for just two or three days. “The fate of this year’s farming depends on how to protect farmland and crops from the flood,” the newspaper said. South Korea on Thursday donated $10 million to the U.N. World Food Programme  for its efforts to help North Korean children and women. Parts of South Korea have seen more than 40 consecutive days of rain, the longest monsoon since 2013, and more is expected across the peninsula. President Moon Jae in on Friday designated seven hardest hit cities and counties as special disaster zones, which allows the areas to get more government aid.

      "By Reuters Staff 2 Min Read SHANGHAI    The central Chinese city of Wuhan, epicentre of the new coronavirus pandemic, raised its flood alert level on Monday as torrential rain and thunderstorms battered swathes of the country, including the Yangtze river on which it sits. Wuhan upgraded its emergency flood response to Level II from Level III, the second highest on its four tier scale, after days of heavy downpours submerged many of its roads. Authorities warned in March that Wuhan and other flood prone cities on the Yangtze’s middle reaches faced higher than usual levels of rainfall this year. Mayor Zhou Xianwang promised that crucial flood defence work would not be affected by the coronavirus outbreak, which saw the city locked down for more than two months. The city was badly hit by devastating floods on the Yangtze in 1998. Torrential rains continued to batter China on Monday from Chongqing in the southwest to Shanghai on the east coast. The provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangsu all declared “yellow alerts”. Water exceeded warning levels at more than 50 locations along China’s rivers, according to data from the Ministry of Water Resources on Monday. Chen Tao, a senior forecaster with the China Meteorological Administration , said regions along the Yangtze could see as much as 400 mm of rainfall in the next three days. Particular attention needed to be paid to small and medium sized rivers and to risks such as mudslides and the inundation of farmland, he said. “Heavy rainfall may be the first step in a chain of disasters,” he was quoted as saying on the bureau’s website. CMA officials told a briefing on Friday that rainfall in June was 13.5% higher than the seasonal norm. Occurrences of torrential rain and thunderstorms were 43% higher than the 2017 2019 average, they added.

      "By Christopher Flavelle, Denise Lu, Veronica Penney, Nadja Popovich and John SchwartzJune 29, 2020 Nearly twice as many properties may be susceptible to flood damage than previously thought, according to a new effort to map the danger. Percentage of properties at risk of flooding during a major storm Independent researchers’ new estimate Official FEMA estimate Official FEMA estimate 3% 20 36 65 No data Percentage of properties at risk of flooding during a major storm Independent researchers’ new estimate Official FEMA estimate Official FEMA estimate 3% 20 36 65 No data Independent researchers’ new estimate Official FEMA estimate Percentage of properties at risk of flooding during a major storm 3% 20 36 65 No data Percentage of properties at risk of flooding during a major storm Percentage of properties at risk of flooding during a major storm 3% 3% 20 20 36 36 65 65 No data No data Official FEMA estimate Official FEMA estimate Independent researchers’ new estimate Percentage of properties at risk of flooding during a major storm No data 3% 20 36 65 Official FEMA estimate Independent researchers’ new estimate  \tAcross much of the United States, the flood risk is far greater than government estimates show, new calculations suggest, exposing millions of people to a hidden threat and one that will only grow as climate change worsens. \tThat new calculation, which takes into account sea level rise, rainfall and flooding along smaller creeks not mapped federally, estimates that 14.6 million properties are at risk from what experts call a 100 year flood, far more than the 8.7 million properties shown on federal government flood maps. A 100 year flood is one with a 1 percent chance of striking in any given year. \tThe federal government’s flood maps guide where and how to build, whether homeowners should buy flood insurance, and how much risk mortgage lenders take on. If the new estimates are broadly accurate, it would mean that homeowners, builders, banks, insurers and government officials nationwide have been making decisions with information that understates their true physical and financial risks. \tNumerous cities nationwide as diverse as Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Buffalo, N.Y., and Chattanooga, Tenn. show the startling gap in the risks. In Chicago alone, 75,000 properties have a previously undisclosed flood risk. And minority communities often face a bigger share of hidden risk. \t“Millions of home and property owners have had no way of knowing the significant risk they face,” said Matthew Eby, founder and executive director of the First Street Foundation, a group of academics and experts based in New York City who compiled the data, creating a website where people can check their own address.Share of properties with hidden flood risk FEMA shows more risk No data +10% +20 +30 +40  \tFederal flood maps, managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have long drawn concerns that they underestimate flood risk. Part of the problem is keeping the maps up to date, which is not only costly and labor intensive, but further complicated as climate change has worsened the dangers. \tIn addition, FEMA’s maps aren’t designed to account for flooding caused by intense rainfall, a growing problem as the atmosphere warms. \tWhen FEMA does issue updated maps, politicians and homeowners often object, hoping to avoid higher federal flood insurance rates. “You can’t appeal your rate. You can only fight your map,” said Roy Wright, who ran the National Flood Insurance Program until 2018. “It turns it into house by house combat.” \tThe First Street Foundation created its flood model, called Flood Factor, using federal elevation and rainfall data, and coastal flooding estimates from hurricanes. The foundation then checked its results against a national database of flood claims and historic flood paths. \tOverall, the results, which cover the contiguous United States including areas the government hasn’t yet mapped for flooding, and places where the federal maps are decades old show a vast increase in risk compared with official estimates. Many inland areas, including swaths of Appalachia and numerous major cities, saw big jumps. \tHowever, there are exceptions, particularly along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast, where the government has more thoroughly studied and planned for floods. There, the federal maps show more buildings at risk than the new model suggests. \tFirst Street said that in some areas, including small municipalities, the model may overestimate flood risk because it doesn’t capture every local flood protection measure, such as pumps or catchment basins. \tFEMA said it welcomed First Street’s initiative, saying it would “complement FEMA’s efforts.” \t“We know there is no perfect science to predict flooding,” a spokeswoman said. “The Flood Factor product may help property owners with the critical decisions they must make and purchase necessary insurance.” \tFirst Street’s calculations indicate that many cities have tens of thousands of properties facing risks not shown on government maps. At the top of that list is Chicago. \tFEMA’s maps show just 0.3 percent of Chicago’s more than 600,000 properties inside the 100 year flood zone. But according to First Street, almost 13 percent of city properties face that risk some 75,000 more than FEMA’s maps show. \tOfficials with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, which oversees stormwater management, said they had not reviewed First Street’s work in detail. But they agreed that significant flood damage occurs outside the areas marked by FEMA’s flood maps, which are intended to show river based flooding, rather than flooding caused by heavy rain. \tThe finding that almost 13 percent of Chicago properties are at risk from rain based flooding “would not surprise me one bit,” said Kevin Fitzpatrick, who supervises sewer infrastructure for the water district. He said the city’s sewer system is generally intended to withstand rainfall from only a five year storm, or a storm with 20 percent odds of happening in any given year. \tThe undisclosed risk isn’t always evenly distributed. \tOne of the Chicago area ZIP codes with the greatest hidden risk is in Englewood, near the South Side, where almost 95 percent of residents are African American. According to FEMA’s maps, none of the properties there are in the 100 year floodplain. But First Street says the number is almost one third.FEMA says 0.3 percent of properties at risk in Chicago First Street says 13 percent of properties at risk in Chicago 5 MILES O’Hare Airport O’Hare Airport Lake Michigan Lake Michigan CHICAGO CHICAGO Englewood Englewood FEMA says 0.3 percent of properties at risk in Chicago First Street says 13 percent of properties at risk in Chicago 5 MILES O’Hare Airport O’Hare Airport Lake Michigan Lake Michigan CHICAGO CHICAGO Englewood Englewood FEMA says 0.3 percent of properties at risk in Chicago First Street says 13 percent of properties at risk in Chicago 5 MILES Lake Michigan Lake Michigan O’Hare Airport O’Hare Airport CHICAGO CHICAGO Englewood Englewood First Street says 13 percent of properties at risk in Chicago FEMA says 0.3 percent of properties at risk in Chicago Lake Michigan Lake Michigan CHICAGO CHICAGO Englewood Englewood 5 MILES First Street says 13 percent of properties at risk in Chicago FEMA says 0.3 percent of properties at risk in Chicago Lake Michigan Lake Michigan CHICAGO CHICAGO Englewood Englewood 5 MILES FEMA says 0.3 percent of properties at risk in Chicago First Street says 13 percent of properties at risk in Chicago 5 MILES O’Hare Airport O’Hare Airport Lake Michigan Lake Michigan CHICAGO CHICAGO Englewood Englewood  \tThat disparity reflects a broader trend. \tIn more than two thirds of states, First Street found that areas with more minority residents also had a greater share of unmapped flood risk than the statewide average. Jeremy Porter, First Street’s director of research and development, said cities seem to invest more in flood protection in areas with higher incomes and property values. \tHeightened flood risk in communities of color doesn’t surprise Marcella Bondie Keenan, program director for climate planning at the Center for Neighborhood Technology. Last year her group found that 87 percent of insurance claims for Chicago flood damage between 2007 and 2016 went to people in communities of color. Among the many risks, residents of flood prone areas often suffer more mold in their homes, which can worsen respiratory conditions, a danger in the current pandemic. \t“We welcome any attention to the urban flooding issue that doesn’t get talked about and is an environmental justice issue,” Mx. Bondie Keenan said. \tAppalachia also appears to face far greater risk than FEMA maps indicate. In both Chattanooga and Charleston, W.Va, FEMA’s maps put well less than 10 percent of properties in the floodplain, while First Street suggests the proportion is one third or greater. A Chattanooga zoning official said he thought First Street’s numbers might be too high. Charleston officials didn’t comment. \tFlood maps can stir up political fights. For instance, when FEMA proposed updated maps last year for Buffalo, adding properties to the floodplain, residents objected. A member of the Buffalo Common Council, David Franczyk, said the updates would “foist unnecessary and unreasonable costs” on citizens. \tFEMA identifies just 0.4 percent of the city’s 93,583 properties as at risk, while First Street says 17.5 percent are at risk a difference of 16,000 properties. Buffalo suffered heavy flooding in 2014 and again last summer. A city spokesman declined to comment. \tSome of the hidden risk is by the shore. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a city of almost 200,000 people, FEMA puts about 41 percent of the city’s 55,000 properties in the floodplain. But according to First Street, the figure is closer to two thirds, or about 13,000 more properties. \t“It seems plausible,” said Richard Benton, Fort Lauderdale’s floodplain manager, when shown First Street’s map. He said the maps did accurately show areas that typically flood despite being outside FEMA’s flood maps.FEMA says 41 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale First Street says 64 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale 2 MILES FORT LAUDERDALE FORT LAUDERDALE Atlantic Ocean Atlantic Ocean FEMA says 41 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale First Street says 64 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale 2 MILES FORT LAUDERDALE FORT LAUDERDALE Atlantic Ocean Atlantic Ocean FEMA says 41 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale First Street says 64 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale 2 MILES FORT LAUDERDALE FORT LAUDERDALE Atlantic Ocean Atlantic Ocean FEMA says 41 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale First Street says 64 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale 2 MILES FORT LAUDERDALE FORT LAUDERDALE Atlantic Ocean FEMA says 41 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale First Street says 64 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale 2 MILES FORT LAUDERDALE FORT LAUDERDALE Atlantic Ocean FEMA says 41 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale First Street says 64 percent of properties at risk in Fort Lauderdale 2 MILES FORT LAUDERDALE FORT LAUDERDALE Atlantic Ocean Atlantic Ocean  \tFEMA is in the process of updating Fort Lauderdale area maps, Mr Benton said, adding that some neighboring municipalities have told him that they intend to fight the new maps, out of concern that too many people would have to buy flood insurance. He declined to say which ones. \tAs with Illinois, the unmapped risk in Florida appears to disproportionately affect minority communities. \tIn one ZIP Code at the western edge of Fort Lauderdale that is 80 percent African American, First Street’s data puts more than 42 percent of properties in the floodplain, while FEMA puts the number at just 6.5 percent. \tWhen Sasha Forbes bought a house nearby in 2016, she checked FEMA’s database, which said the home wasn’t in a floodplain. But after she moved in, local officials sent her a letter warning that her house was in an area that floods. \t“There was no knowledge of that when we were purchasing the house,” said Ms. Forbes, a member of the Broward County Climate Change Task Force and a policy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, where she works with community groups to make development in cities more inclusive. \tMs. Forbes pointed out that black families tend to be more exposed to flooding because their homes are often built on cheaper land in historically segregated areas. Investing in flood protection there would be a good start, she said, adding that the public discussion of climate change should address why minorities are more vulnerable in the first place. “We are really silent on the impact of race,” Ms. Forbes said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the agency responsible for treating wastewater in Chicago and the surrounding area.

      "By Reuters Staff 2 Min Read SHANGHAI    China’s biggest river, the Yangtze, and several of its tributaries have risen to dangerous levels after days of heavy rain, forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes and triggering an unprecedented emergency response alert. China has seen unusually high levels of rain this flood season, with southwest and central regions in the Yangtze river basin bearing the brunt of flooding. The Ministry of Water Resources said on Monday that 38 tributaries on the upper reaches of the Yangtze were now higher than their warning levels, 19 dangerously so. The southwestern province of Sichuan, which includes a major upstream section of the Yangtze, has raised its flood emergency response to its highest level, the first time it has ever done so, with its rivers overflowing and villages and farmland inundated. The Qingyi river, an upper Yangtze tributary, had seen its worst flooding in a century, Sichuan’s flood control authority said, with the city of Yaan forced to evacuate more than 36,000 people as the river burst its banks on Monday. The Yangtze and Huai river basins have seen the highest level of rainfall since records began in 1961, officials have said. As many as 634 rivers throughout the country have exceeded their official flood warning levels. By last week, 63 million people had been affected by floods, 12.7% higher than the average over the past five years, said Zhou Xuewen, vice minister at the Ministry of Emergency Management. The cost of direct economic damage reached 179 billion yuan , 15.5% higher than the five year average, he added.

      " AfghanistanKey Highlights • Heavy rainfall has led to flash floods affecting over 500 families  throughout the centre and east of the country. Numbers of people affected are expected to increase as assessments are ongoing. • Unconfirmed reports suggest approximately 100 people have died and 100 people have been injured. Approximately 500 houses have been damaged and 300 400 families have been displaced and are currently hosted by relatives or neighbors. • Local residents, provincial authorities, NGOs, and UN agencies are providing support to flood affected families; search and rescue operations are underway. Situation Overview: Localised floods caused by heavy rainfall were reported on the evening of 25 August in Parun City and Mandi Village of Nuristan province, Rodat district of Nangahar province, Mehtarlam and Alishang districts of Laghman Province, and Parcha and Charikar districts of Parwan province. Although damage is widespread, Parwan province is currently the most severely impacted. Early information shared at today’s PDMC meeting indicates approximately 100 people have died and 100 people have been injured. Approximately 500 houses have been either partially damaged or destroyed. 300 400 families have been displaced. Power and water systems are also reportedly damaged; agricultural land and public infrastructure have also been impacted. Joint assessment teams have been initiated. Government authorities are currently leading search and rescue operations. Flooding has also reportedly impacted Kapisa and Panjsher Provinces, although no casualties have been reported there. ANDMA is currently collecting data for potential joint assessments in these areas as well. The Afghanistan Meteorological Department has issued an additional heavy rain warning until 27 August for provinces in the north east and east of Afghanistan, with flash flood warnings for Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktya provinces. Humanitarian Impact: Affected families need immediate food, shelter, household items and WASH support. WASH needs, in particular, have been! lagged by ANDMA in Parwan province. Longer term shelter repair solutions are also anticipated to be required. While the number of people impacted in 2020 by natural disasters  is approximately one quarter of those impacted in 2019 , displaced families will also have to contend with COVID 19 risks, complicating the response. Compliance with COVID 19 preventative measures is not possible for the majority of displaced families, exposing vulnerable people to heightened risks. The impact on humanitarian operations is, at present, minimal. Reports have been received that parts of the Kabul  Jalalabad highway are blocked in the Surobi area due to encroachment of gravel/land slips. Coordination: The Provincial Disaster Committee of Parwan is coordinating the local response. Search and rescue activities are underway using staff and machinery of the Public Works Department, DoRRD, ARCS, DoPH, Police, and ANA, and local residents are supporting. Injured people are being transported from disaster affected areas to Parwan and Kabul Hospitals. Provincial authorities and local residents are providing food, drinking water and warm clothes to affected people. IOM and partners have indicated availability of 20,000 emergency shelter and NFI packages currently warehoused in Kabul, which can support 5,000 affected families. An additional 6,500 emergency shelter and NFI packages warehoused in Nangarhar are also pre positioned to support 1,500 families, should they be needed. The Provincial Governor of Parwan organised a PDMC meeting on 26 August. The State Minister of Disaster Management announced that food and drinking water has been distributed to affected people and that school buildings will be used to provide temporary shelter. All Eastern Region OCT members are on standby to respond following assessments. The Eastern Region ICCT also met today  to prioritise flood response preparedness actions to mitigate against further flood impact.\n",

      "Communities along the Calder Valley in West Yorkshire are assessing the damage following severe flooding caused by Storm Ciara. The Environment Agency said about 100mm of rain fell in a 12 18 hour period, leading to raging torrents in places. Calderdale Council said 500 homes and about 400 businesses had been flooded. The area was devastated by flooding at Christmas in 2015 and millions of pounds were invested in flood defences. However, some of those, including a Â£30m scheme in Mytholmroyd, are not due to be completed until the summer. Amelie Lavan, a flood warden in the town, said: The walls are not finished so of course you've got torrential rain and in 24 hours the whole place is flooded again. Martin Slater from the Environment Agency said river levels were falling but remain high, urging people to stay vigilant. The catchments are really saturated and there not places for any future rain to go, so we do ask people to be really careful. Some of our measuring devices recorded around about 100mm rain in a 12 to 18 hour period, so that a lot of rain falling in a very short period of time. Enormous quantities have fallen in a short period of time so that turns those small becks into raging torrents in places. Calderdale Council said it had opened up a number of community hubs to provide support and cleaning equipment. Barry Greenwood, from the Calder Valley flood prevention group, said his daughter hair salon in Hebden Bridge had been flooded again. The water marks are about three to four feet deep this time, he said, and river sludge had covered almost everything inside the shop.  Mr Greenwood said something had to be done to stop repeat flooding. We can't carry on like this. We've got to stop the problem at its source that the only way we are going to survive down this valley. He said more work was needed to slow down the volume of water coming off the moors. Steven Lord, who runs the Harrison Lord Gallery in Brighouse, said the damage to his business was extensive. What you are left with is everything covered in this filthy black sludge, he said. It very difficult to pick yourself back up. You put your life and soul into a business and it just washed away. Jon and Mary Duerden hardware store in Mytholmroyd was flooded for the third time in 10 years and the couple say they will have to close. It not just a little bit of a mess you have to clean up, it the building itself needs a lot of work on it, Mrs Duerden said. We have been at it for 31 years. Jon is in his 70s, I'm in my 60s, we just can't keep doing this. Helen Macintyre, from Turtle Yoga in Halifax, said despite the damage to businesses people had rallied around. The support from people has been amazing. So many people wanting to come and help. People offering me a room so I can at least do some classes this week. In addition to the damage to homes and businesses, a number of roads remain closed in West Yorkshire. In Elland, the bridge over the Calder was shut after a large shipping container became wedged beneath it on Sunday. It reopened on Monday morning. The historic bridge was closed for months when it was damaged during the Boxing Day floods and cost Â£5m to rebuild. Michaela Thackery, from Elland, said: It just shocking. Does it mean we are going to be cut off again? It scary. More than 3,000 properties were flooded in the area in 2015. Since then a number of flood alleviation schemes, in Mytholmroyd, Hebden Bridge, and Brighouse, were proposed but have not yet been completed. The government has announced it has activated its emergency Bellwin scheme, which allows councils to claim back some of the costs of providing support to flood hit communities.

      "By Rina Chandran, Thomson Reuters Foundation 3 Min Read BANGKOK, Jan 14    More than 200 Jakarta residents have filed a lawsuit against the governor of Indonesia’s capital as they seek to hold authorities responsible over their inaction during some of the deadliest flooding in years, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said. At least 60 people were killed and nearly 175,000 were displaced after some of the heaviest rain since records began caused flash floods and landslides in Jakarta and nearby towns on Dec. 31 and New Year’s Day. The lawsuit, which was filed at a Jakarta district court on Monday by 243 residents against Governor Anies Baswedan, said authorities had failed to take sufficient action and sought 42.3 billion rupiah  in compensation. “People have been affected tremendously. They deserve compensation and assurance from the government that their concerns are being addressed,” said Alvon Kurnia Palma at the Indonesia Legal Aid Foundation, who is representing plaintiffs. “This is not the first time we are filing a lawsuit against the government for floods, but this time we have clear evidence linking the government’s negligence to the damage caused. People are angry that nothing has been done,” he said. A spokesman for Governor Baswedan did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. With one of the world’s longest coastlines, Indonesia is extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts. Rising sea levels and the inability of existing infrastructure to cope with excess water during the monsoon season have resulted in regular flooding in Jakarta, which is home to more than 10 million people. Despite previous flooding disasters in Jakarta and ample data pointing to excessive rainfall, authorities failed to warn residents and were slow in responding to the recent crisis, Palma told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Part of the central government’s solution for Jakarta’s floods is to move the capital to the island of Borneo by 2023. Plans to improve Jakarta’s flood defences include building two dams and works on the city’s biggest river. President Joko Widodo has blamed the flooding on delays to these projects. It is not just the floods that Jakarta residents are unhappy about: last year, a group of residents filed a lawsuit against authorities for failing to curb worsening air pollution. The lawsuits are a sign of the growing frustration of residents with the government’s inaction, said Shobhakar Dhakal, a professor in the department of energy, environment and climate change at the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok. “It is a way for people to put pressure on governments to act, and to raise awareness around the issues,” he said.\n",

      "Coastal areas forced to erect flood defences to counter impact of waves whipped up by 100mph gusts  Last modified on Tue 29 Dec 2020 08.45 GMT High winds have added to widespread flooding as Storm Bella continued to wreak havoc across much of the UK. In many coastal areas, communities were forced to erect flood defences to counter the impact of waves whipped up by gusts that reached 100mph overnight. People in the north west awoke to sleet and snow showers on Sunday, while the Met Office issued 112 flood warnings across a swath of land from Cornwall to Kent. Two of the warnings were severe – at the Cogenhoe Mill caravan site near Northampton, and on the banks of the River Nene near Billing Aquadrome – after days of wintry weather during the Christmas break, while an imminent cold snap with icy and wintry conditions was forecast. The highest wind speed was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight, reaching 106mph overnight on Saturday. Gusts of 83mph were recorded at the coastal village of Aberdaron in north Wales, and regions on the south coast of England, including Dorset, got close to 80mph. Hundreds in the Plymouth and Truro were left without power as electricity lines collapsed. Similar power losses were recorded in Cardiff, Swansea, Telford in Shropshire, and Nottingham. The Met Office warned of the risks posed by flying debris and the damage caused to exposed buildings. The Newquay police response team in Cornwall said Storm Bella was so severe it was “throwing trees over the roads”. The North Yorkshire fire and rescue service said they used a boat to rescue two men and two dogs from a vehicle stuck in floodwater in Hawes at 12.37am on Sunday. In Aysgarth, a man and a woman were also rescued by boat from the roof of their car at 2.40am after they drove into deep floodwater. Firefighters walked a woman to safety through shallow water in Wensley at 3.35am after a minor collision while driving through floods. In Hove, Sussex, a tree fell on to a £363,000 Rolls Royce. Tree surgeons were called in to saw up the branches and lift them off the shattered vehicle with a hoist. Some people managed to find new ways to enjoy themselves even at the height of the storm, including kayakers who took to new waters around the UK – among them Worcester racecourse and the flooded A1101 at Welney, Norfolk. The disruption continued into Sunday morning when flooding on the tracks caused cancellations and delays. All trains between Bournemouth and Southampton Central were stopped because of water on the line, Great Western Railway said, and one of the major lines into London was also blocked when a tree fell on the tracks in Haslemere, Surrey. About 25mm of rain is due to fall on Sunday in parts of the south west England and Wales, with up to 60mm on high ground. Flood defences have been put in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, and extra pumps deployed to the Welches Dam and Soham Lodge areas. Scotland, Northern Ireland, north Wales and parts of northern England are also subject to a yellow warning for snow and ice from Sunday night into Monday. In its early stages the storm forced people living next to the River Great Ouse in Bedfordshire to flee their homes on Christmas Day, as floodwater rose to dangerous levels. On Sunday the Coral Welsh Grand National meeting at Chepstow was abandoned after 27mm of rain fell overnight. In Cirencester, Gloucestershire, council officials ordered the distribution of sandbags as heavy rain caused flooding. Through the evening and into Monday, meteorologists are warning the snow and ice could also pose a risk to more central and southern areas of England. Further into the week and towards the New Year, conditions will remain cold with sunshine and the possibility of wintry showers, the Met Office said.\n",

      "Members of the public vent frustration that it has taken more than three weeks for PM to tour affected areas Last modified on Mon 9 Mar 2020 04.04 GMT Boris Johnson has been met with cries of “traitor” after arriving in flood hit Worcestershire more than three weeks after the crisis began. The prime minister arrived on the banks of the River Severn in Bewdley on Sunday afternoon, and was taken to view flood defences by Environment Agency staff. However, some members of the public heckled Johnson in fury that he has stayed away from the affected areas until now – instead spending the half term break in one of the government’s grace and favour mansions in Kent. Johnson told residents he would “get Bewdley done” and said he was “so sorry to hear it” when he was told that some homes had been overwhelmed by as much as 2ft of water. He later tweeted a video of him surrounded by well wishers andthose who wanted selfies. As he walked around the town, many asked toshake his hand and shouted friendly greetings, but one person heckledhim with “do your fucking job”. After speaking to the Environment Agency officials, he said they discussed “what permanent defences can we put in and what’s the business case”. He added: “What we’re doing is we are doubling the funding for flood defences to £5.2bn, and we’re also going to be looking at all the things we can do upstream.” The extra money for flood defences is due to be announced at Wednesday’s budget by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor. He will say flood defence spending will increase from £2.6bn to £5.2bn between 2015 and 2021, giving protection to 336,000 homes in England through 2,000 new schemes. However, Johnson’s reluctance to visit flood hit areas himself has led to criticism from Labour that he is a “part time prime minister”. Last week, the prime minister claimed he had been advised to stay away by emergency services in case he got in the way. Speaking to ITV’s This Morning, he said: “They  said to us: ‘All you’ll do is distract us and disrupt the business of helping people with the immediate crisis.’ So what I was doing was directing operations ... Obviously, I’m working around the clock on various things, as indeed is the government.” Critics have pointed out that he found time to visit flooded areas of the north of England during the election campaign when he was seeking votes.\n",

      "Heavy rains in Sudan have intensified over the past week, causing flooding, destruction of infrastructure, houses and livelihoods, and leading to displacement in multiple locations across the country. Khartoum, Blue Nile and River Nile are amongst the most affected states. Floods have also led to damages and affected people in other regions, including El Gezira, West Kordofan and South Darfur. In the Blue Nile State, the state with highest number of people affected so far, the Bout Earth Dam, in Tadamon locality, exceeded its full capacity and collapsed, following the strong rainfall received on 29 July. At least 12 neighbourhoods downstream in Bout Town were flooded due the incident, affecting around 3,900 people. Most of them were rendered homeless and are now sheltering with host families, as nearly 190 houses were destroyed and 590 damaged, according to Government’s Humanitarian Aid Commission . More houses are expected to collapse, as the rains continue in a zone where the land is already extremely wet. . Heavy rain continues to affect 14 of the 18 States, causing widespread floods and leading to an increasing number of casualties and damage. According to UN OCHA, at least 1,100 people have been displaced  and more than 50,000 people affected. In addition, media report 10 deaths, 3 injured and more than 3,000 houses destroyed or damaged. National authorities and humanitarian partners are monitoring the situation and are providing relief to those affected. For the next 24 hours, more heavy rain is expected across southern States. Sudan Meteorological Authority has warned that more heavy rain is expected over August and September, which risks leading to further flooding and displacement.  An estimated 125,000 refugees and internally displaced people have been affected in total, particularly in East Sudan, White Nile, Darfur and Khartoum, many in urgent need of shelter and other emergency assistance. Rains have been particularly heavy in North Darfur, leaving an estimated 35,000 IDPs, locals and refugees in need of help, and where 15 people have tragically died and a further 23 gone missing.  As of 8 September,  nearly 100 fatalities, 46 injured people, thousands of people displaced , and over 100,000 houses destroyed or damaged across the aforementioned States. Since mid July, around 506,000 people have been affected across 17 States , with more than 110,000 of them during the first week of September. In the Khartoum State around 100,000 people are currently in need of urgent shelters, household supplies, clean water, sanitation, and health services. Over the next 24 hours, moderate rain is forecast over south west and south east Sudan, with locally heavy rain over central North Kordofan State.  At least 111,000 houses were either destroyed or severely damaged by floodwater and the number of people critically affected exceeds 770,000. Nearly 16,000 latrines were destroyed and the collapse of the Bout Dam hinders access to water to more than 100,000 people in Blue Nile State, but all 18 States of the country have been affected. There is a need for food, shelter, hygiene and sanitation items to assist those affected. Two weeks ago, the Government declared a State of Emergency in the country due to the unprecedented flooding. Light to locally moderate rain is forecast over southern Sudan on 22 23 September.  Rains started to subside and flood waters are receding in Sudan, after months of heavy rainfall that left more than 875,000 people affected by unprecedented flooding. Torrential downpours, landslides, flash and riverine flooding have killed over 150 people and left a path of destruction in all states across the country, according to the Government Humanitarian Aid Commission data. More than 30 per cent of the water samples analyzed across 13 states were contaminated and the extensive damage to hundreds of water sources, the collapse of several thousands of latrines increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. Over 10 million people are now at risk of contracting water borne diseases, and more than 4.5 million are exposed to vector borne diseases, an increase of nearly 100 per cent if compared with April 2020.

      "Water levels are dropping but more rain is coming for parts of the flood ravaged South, prolonging the misery in neighborhoods with long clean ups ahead State of emergency declared in the Southern states RIDGELAND, Miss.    Forecasters expected more heavy rains in parts of the flood ravaged South on Tuesday, prolonging the misery for worried people who still can't get back in homes surrounded by water. Some of the hardest hit areas were under a flash flood watch, as the National Weather Service said as much as 2 inches  of rain, and even more in some spots was expected to fall in a short amount of time in central Mississippi. The national Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, projected         the greatest likelihood of heavy rains in a band from eastern Louisiana across central parts of Mississippi and Alabama and into far west Georgia. Authorities around Mississippi capital city of Jackson warned hundreds of residents not to return home until they get an all clear following devastating flooding on Monday. The receding flood left muddy water marks on the sides of cars at the Harbor Pines Mobile Home Community in suburban Ridgeland, not far from where managers of the Ross Barnett Reservoir have been trying to contain the swollen Pearl River. Water still surrounded dozens of trailer homes on Tuesday, but the water level had fallen 2 feet  or more since Monday. Anxious to get back into the home she evacuated on Thursday, Gloria Vera couldn't reach her trailer because it was still surrounded by as much as 5 feet  of water. She didn't yet know if water got inside. “I took nothing from the house when I left, only the clothes I am wearing, Vera said in Spanish. Dorothy Freeman felt fortunate because her mobile home was above water and she was able to get back in long enough to feed her cat and pick up personal items including her Bible. “I’m praying for the people in the Jackson area that were hit even harder than us,” said Freeman, 87, who has lived in the community 21 years. Crews were going lot to lot to check the duct work beneath mobile homes to determine how many had been inundated by water. The power remained off as a precaution and it wasn't clear when residents would be allowed back home. A near record rainy winter led to agonizing choices for reservoir managers, who have had to release water that worsens flooding for some people living downstream while saving many other properties from damage. The intensity and frequency of extreme rain events that fuel major flooding have increased in the Southeast, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment, released by the White House in 2018. Southern states are particularly vulnerable to increasingly heavy rains, according to the report, which cites four floods that each did more than $1 billion in damage between 2014 and 2016. In the Savannah, Tennessee, area, two houses slid down a muddy bluff just below the Pickwick Dam on Saturday as the Tennessee Valley Authority released more than 2.5 million gallons  per second, adding to the anguish for owners of about 75 flooded properties downstream. Hardin County Fire Chief and Emergency Management Director Melvin Martin said the landslide claimed not only two houses, whose residents got out safely, but also about 100 yards  of the blufftop road. Meanwhile, most of the homes down by the river are vacation homes that were built on stilts, Martin said. Boat captain Sam Evans, who lives in a historic riverboat on Pickwick Lake, says this year flooding is among the worst he seen. Navigating the Tennessee River by boat, he watched the banks gradually erode, and said it was only a matter of time before the bluff gave way. It has slowly been eroding and it finally let go, Evans told The Associated Press on Tuesday. The area suffered a devastating flood in 2003, but then about 14 years passed without a catastrophe, and developers got busy selling riverfront properties, Evans said. He thinks the buyers weren't fully aware of the danger. Out of towners came in that didn’t do their homework, he said. “Here comes a flood and it wipes them out ... Buyer beware when you buy below the dam.  Things changed about three years ago, he said. We've had three floods in the last three years, about the same time every year, Evans said. Darrell Guinn, a manager at the TVA River Forecast Center, said Tuesday that the river system is now at level where it can absorb more rain without further impacting flooded areas. Sprawling fields turned into large lakes throughout West Tennessee, including in the small town of Halls, where a cold rain fell steadily Tuesday. A Tennessee Department of Transportation crew worked to close state Highway 88 outside Halls, as water began moving over the road that connects U.S. Highway 51 and the Mississippi River.\n",
