      "LOS ANGELES — Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of giant sequoias this year, adding to a staggering two-year death toll that accounts for up to nearly a fifth of Earth’s largest trees, officials said Friday.\n",
      "Fires in Sequoia National Park and the surrounding national forest that also bears the trees’ name tore through more than a third of groves in California and torched an estimated 2,261 and 3,637 sequoias, which are the largest trees by volume. Fires in the same area last year killed an unprecedented 7,500 to 10,400 of the 75,000 trees that are only native in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range.\n",
      "Intense fires that burned hot enough and high enough to kill so many giant sequoias — trees once considered nearly fire-proof — put an exclamation point on the impact of climate change. The combination of a warming planet that has created hotter droughts and a century of fire suppression that choked forests with thick undergrowth have fueled blazes that have sounded the death knell for trees that date back to ancient civilizations.\n",
      "“The sobering reality is that we have seen another huge loss within a finite population of these iconic trees that are irreplaceable in many lifetimes,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. “As spectacular as these trees are we really can’t take them for granted. To ensure that they’re around for our kids and grandkids and great grandkids, some action is necessary.”\n",
      "California has seen its largest fires in the past five years, with last year setting a record for most acreage burned. So far, the second-largest amount of land has burned this year.\n",
      "After last year’s Castle and SQF Complex fires took officials by surprise by wiping out so many sequoias, extraordinary measures were taken to save the largest and oldest trees this year.\n",
      "The General Sherman tree — the largest living thing on earth — and other ancient trees that are the backdrop for photos that often fail to capture grandeur of the giant sequoias was wrapped in a foil blanket.\n",
      "A type of fire-retardant gel, similar to that used as absorbent in baby’s diapers, was dropped on tree canopies that can exceed 200 feet (60 meters) in height. Sprinklers watered down trunks and flammable matter was raked away from trees.\n",
      "The measures spared the Giant Forest, the premiere grove of ancient trees in the park, but the measures couldn’t be deployed everywhere.\n",
      "The bulk of the Suwanee grove in the park burned in an extreme fire in the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River drainage. The Starvation Complex grove in Sequoia National Forest was largely destroyed, based on estimates of how much of it burned at high-severity.\n",
      "In 2013, the park had done climate modeling that predicted extreme fires wouldn’t jeopardize sequoias for another 50 years, said Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science at the two parks. But that was at the start of what became a punishing five-year drought that essentially broke the model.\n",
      "Amid the drought in 2015, the park saw giant sequoias torched for the first time. Two fires in 2017 killed more giant sequoias, serving as a warning for what was to come.\n",
      "“Then the Castle Fire happened and it was like, ‘Oh, my God,’” Brigham said. “We went from the warning sign to hair on fire. To lose 7,000 trees in one fire is crazy.”\n",
      "A full mortality count from last year’s fire is still not available because crews in the forest were in the process of confirming how many trees died when lightning struck Sept. 9, igniting the Windy Fire in Sequoia National Forest and the SQF Complex in the park, Brigham said.\n",
      "Not all the news from the estimates was bleak.\n",
      "While fire burned into 27 groves and large numbers of trees were incinerated, a lot of low-intensity fire that sequoias need to thrive cleared out vegetation and the heat will open cones so they can spread their seeds.\n",
      "Areas, however, where fire burned so hot and seeds were killed, may not be able to regenerate. For the first time, the park is considering planting seedlings to preserve the species.\n",
      "“I’m not ready to give up on giant sequoias,” Brigham said.\n",

      "Two of the fires, which were caught quickly, were set behind fire lines where crews were fighting the Dixie Fire and could have trapped them had they grown, prosecutors have said.\n",
      "The other two fires were contained at between 200 square feet and less than one acre, according to court documents.\n",
      "A public defender listed as representing Maynard did not immediately return a request for comment late Thursday.\n",
      "Court documents do not appear to detail a motive. Maynard, who was arrested in August, denied setting any fires to investigators, according to documents. \n",
      "Maynard has, at times, been an adjunct faculty member and part-time lecturer Santa Clara University and Sonoma State University, but not recently, the universities have said. \n",
      "At the time of the arsons, he was living in his car, according to court documents. \n",
      "He faces up to 20 years in prison on each count of arson, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.\n",
      "The Dixie Fire would become the second largest in recorded state history, burning more than 963,000 acres. The fire started on July 13 and was fully contained on Oct. 25, according to fire officials. The cause is under investigation.\n",

      "Authorities in Northern California last week announced the arrest of a woman who they say ignited a wind-whipped wildfire that quickly tore through steep, rugged terrain, destroying 144 buildings, prompting the evacuation of thousands of people and becoming one of the state's more destructive blazes this year.\n",
      "The woman, Alexandra Souverneva, 30, a onetime yoga teacher from the San Francisco Bay Area whom a former colleague recalled as \"brilliant,\" is among more than 100 people who have been accused of wildland arson and arrested this year by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.\n",
      "The charge alleges a rare but significant act that has come into sharper focus as parched, overgrown forests explode across thousands of acres in days.\n",
      "\"It is difficult to grasp when disaster like this is, apparently, not a natural disaster, but we have a suspect, and this might be an arson case,\" Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said during a community meeting Saturday.\n",
      "Souverneva has pleaded not guilty.\n",
      "Wildfires are usually accidental, ignited by damaged power lines, vehicles and logging equipment, said Ed Nordskog, a retired arson investigator with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and a co-author of \"Arson Investigation in the Wildlands.\"\n",
      "While most wildfire agencies attribute about 10 percent of blazes to arson, Nordskog said the real number could be twice as high — a result of decades of officials' prioritizing suppression over investigations.\n",
      "\"If you don't send an investigator, you don't have arson,\" he said.\n",
      "The intentional setting of a wildland fire can have swift, profound consequences. As Nordskog put it: \"They literally have the power of an atomic bomb at their fingertips. They can burn an entire town down if the conditions are right.\"\n",
      "In 2006, for instance, a wind-driven blaze burned across 40,000 acres in Southern California, destroying dozens of homes and killing five firefighters. Raymond Oyler, a mechanic from Riverside County, was convicted of arson and murder and sentenced to death.\n",
      "In 2008, a former volunteer firefighter from Northern California, Robert Eason, was convicted of setting a dozen fires north of Sacramento, including one that burned 1,000 acres and killed 200 sheep. Investigators said Eason used a sophisticated time-delay device to ignite the fires.\n",
      "Unlike urban arsonists, whose ages, genders and races vary, wildland arsonists tend to be middle-age men, said Nordskog, who also wrote \"The Arsonist Profiles: Analyzing Arson Motives and Behavior.\" Although lighters and matches are the preferred methods of ignition, some people, like Eason, use time-delay devices, such as matches wrapped around a cigarette, he said.\n",
      "\"When they burst into flames, they're seven to 15 miles away,\" Nordskog said.\n",
      "Although some arsonists act for thrills, Nordskog said, anger, frustration and mental illness are more common motives. Just as common is how daunting the investigations can be. They're often in remote areas, with ignition points that could be devastated as firefighters work to extinguish the blazes, he said.\n",
      "Fire officials said Souverneva was arrested Wednesday night after she emerged from the brush near a fire line northeast of Redding in Shasta County. She had a working lighter in her pocket, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said Friday, and told firefighters that she was dehydrated and needed medical treatment.\n",
      "According to a Cal Fire report obtained by the Record Searchlight of Redding, Souverneva said she was hiking to Canada and tried to boil water that she found in a puddle. Her attempts failed, the report said, but she drank the water anyway — she believed it was mixed with bear urine — then walked uphill and saw smoke and airplanes “dropping pink stuff.”\n",
      "Souverneva was taken into custody on suspicion of arson.\n",
      "Because of a declared state of emergency, Souverneva faces an enhanced sentence of nine years if she is convicted, Bridgett said. She said authorities are \"aware\" of other fires locally and around the state that Souverneva \"may be linked to.\" Bridgett declined to provide additional details.\n",
      "Bridgett, who also declined to discuss a possible motive, said there was no indication that Souverneva was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Nor did she appear mentally ill, Bridgett said, although witnesses who saw her earlier said she was acting \"irrationally,\" Cal Fire said in a statement.\n",
      "Souverneva pleaded not guilty to felony arson. Her attorney, Shana Vegvary, said that Souverneva was \"asserting her innocence\" and that \"no evidence has been presented to the contrary.\"\n",
      "\"We request that the public not prejudge this case,\" she said.\n",
      "Relatives in the Bay Area did not respond to requests for comment. A former colleague and instructor who taught Souverneva at Avalon Yoga International, in Palo Alto, recalled her as a brilliant student who attended the California Institute of Technology and worked for pharmaceutical companies before she burned out on \"big money-grubbing corporations.\"\n",
      "\"I thought she was an idealistic kid,\" said Steve Farmer, the chief executive of Avalon. \"She was into conservation and forests.\"\n",
      "Farmer said he hadn't seen her since the pandemic started, when Avalon closed, although he planned to rehire her after it reopened. \"She would have been the last person I would have thought to get involved in something like this,\" he said.\n",
      "As of Monday, the fire in Shasta County had destroyed dozens of homes and grown to nearly 9,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. Firefighters had surrounded half of the blaze with containment lines.\n",

      "Standing near an aluminum foil-wrapped welcome sign at Sequoia National Park in Northern California, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday signed a bill directing more than $15 billion to combat wildfires, drought and other climate change-driven challenges facing the state.\n",
      "Newsom signed the spending bill while touring portions of the KNP Complex Fire, where some of the world’s oldest and largest sequoias have been threatened by wildfire in recent days.\n",
      "\"It's an unprecedented investment by any state in U.S. history,\" he said. \"We have a responsibility in California to get things done because we are the tip of the spear.\"\n",
      "The climate package includes $5.2 billion for drought response and resilience, $3.7 billion for urban greening projects and coastal protection efforts, and $3.9 billion to fast-track the state's goal of switching to all zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.\n",
      "Newsom also approved nearly $1 billion in new spending to prevent wildfires, signaling a policy shift in a state that historically focused more on putting out fires than stopping them before they start.\n",
      "California spent $3.4 billion on wildfire protection last year, more than quadruple the level 15 years ago and a reflection of the reality that wildfires are getting bigger and more destructive from climate change. Six of the state's 10 largest wildfires have happened in the past two years.\n",
      "But state officials have spent the vast majority of that money on extinguishing fires, a job that has become harder as the fires have gotten bigger and hotter. This year, Newsom and the state Legislature agreed to dramatically increase spending on prevention.\n",
      "The initial outlay was about $500 million, but with a record-breaking budget surplus they were able to add nearly $1 billion more for a total of $1.5 billion.\n",
      "“Conditions have never been more challenging,” Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, said. “Expanding our upfront proactive actions is essential to address the wildfire risks we now face.”\n",
      "Scientists have long warned that the weather will get wilder as the world warms. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years.\n",
      "Most of the wildfire prevention money will pay for things like clearing brush and dead trees that act as kindling when fires start, causing them to quickly burn out of control before firefighters can contain them.\n",
      "There's money to hire inspectors to make sure newer homes built in the state's wildfire-prone areas comply with building codes requiring fire-resistant materials. And there's money for the state to intentionally set fires when conditions are right to burn away fuel that would otherwise help larger fires burn during the dry season.\n",
      "The money Newsom approved is the final piece of the state's $262.5 billion operating budget. The spending Newsom approved Thursday also includes $1.2 billion for things like water recycling projects, cleaning up contaminated water sources and grants to help communities plan for climate change.\n",
      "Republicans have criticized the spending because it does not include money for water storage projects, like building new reservoirs. California voters approved about $2.7 billion in 2014 for water storage projects. But so far, none of those have been built.\n",

      "RENO, Nev. — When the Caldor Fire swooped down toward South Lake Tahoe in California, Melissa Benavidez and her family knew it was time to go.\n",
      "Her husband, a municipal firefighter, urged Benavidez to pack up their three children and head to safety while he stayed behind to work 12-hour shifts. Benavidez, a teacher, tried to make the experience fun for her family. They headed south to the Santa Cruz boardwalk and visited relatives in the San Joaquin Valley.\n",
      "Despite her best efforts, Benavidez’s children felt the stress of displacement and uncertainty.\n",
      "“They have been acting out quite a bit — fighting with each other constantly, lots of mental and emotional breakdowns,” she said. “They’re ready to be back to some normalcy.”\n",
      "Relief for the Benavidez family came about nine days into evacuation when a friend told them about a free, pop-up day camp created for children displaced by the Dixie and Caldor fires.\n",
      "For nearly two weeks in September, Project:Camp took up residency at the Terry Lee Wells Nevada Discovery Museum in Reno, a little more than an hour's drive from South Lake Tahoe.\n",
      "The camp welcomed dozens of children between the ages of 6 and 16, encouraging them to climb up a two-story jungle gym, splash about a model of the local Truckee River and explore the galaxy through an exhibit developed in collaboration with NASA. It also paired children with volunteer counselors trained in trauma-informed care, who were prepared to address emotional outbursts and help kids cope with the stress of evacuating or losing their homes.\n",
      "And it gave parents a much-needed respite during the day, providing space to contact insurance companies, stay updated on evacuation orders and process their own anxiety.\n",
      "“I haven’t had a lot of down time, but now I've been able to be by myself and go through my own emotions,” said Lindsey Simon, whose 8-year-old son spent a week at the camp.\n",
      "“When they’re in a setting like this, he gets tired at the end of the day so he’s calmer at home,” she added. “Otherwise, it’s just chaos and it’s not fun.”\n",
      "Natural disasters affect some 175 million children across the globe every year, triggering lasting consequences that can include anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. Chronic mental health problems have been observed in children up to four years after a major disaster, according to a 2015 study published in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry that looked at the long-term effects of hurricanes and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n",
      "Prolonged or repeated exposure to natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, flooding and even drought and heat waves, can also affect a child’s ability to learn. According to research published by the Society for Research in Child Development, trauma can change a child’s brain anatomy and function, making learning, memory and concentration more difficult for young people.\n",
      "“We know that kids are one of the most vulnerable populations when they experience natural disasters,” said Betty Lai, a professor of counseling, developmental and educational psychology at Boston College. “They really depend on adults to help them through these situations, but they also have fewer experiences to make sense of what it means when your world is turned upside down.”\n",
      "Each child reacts differently to traumatic events. Where one might act out for days or weeks, another might bounce back almost immediately. The difference often comes down to previous experiences and how parents are handling their own stress, according to Melissa Brymer, director of Terrorism and Disaster Programs at the UCLA–Duke National Center for Child Traumatic Stress.\n",
      "“It’s not about the numbers, but the severity and intensity of events,” she said. “A kid is going to be more impacted if they lose their home or lose a loved one.”\n",
      "This year, with dozens of wildfires raging at the same time as hurricanes, heat waves and the Covid-19 pandemic, families are forced to tackle multiple traumatic events simultaneously. Having a plan and sharing those preparations can help both parents and children manage the initial shock of being suddenly displaced, Brymer said.\n",
      "“Encourage kids to pack their stuff so they have comforting items,” she said. “Younger kids feed off their parents, and if parents are coping well in a disaster, that will help kids cope.”\n",
      "Giving both parents and children space to be themselves is one of the goals behind Project:Camp, according to its founder.\n",
      "It first originated in 2017 following Hurricane Harvey, which killed 68 people and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage. The hurricane forced the closure of daycare programs and camps throughout the area, compounding emergencies for parents who badly needed help with their children and time to figure out what to do next in the midst of a two-week disaster.\n",
      "Mikey Latner, founder and executive director of Project:Camp, was part of a national camp network when Hurricane Harvey hit. When colleagues in Texas put out an alert for help caring for children displaced by the hurricane, Latner flew from California to Texas to run logistics at a pop-up camp in Houston.\n",
      "During that hurricane, Latner helped feed some 350 children. The experience stayed with him, leading to a similar but smaller camp several months later during the Tubbs Fire in Northern California and then again in 2018 during the Woolsey Fire in Southern California.\n",
      "Latner hopes to eventually make Project:Camp national with the goal of setting up sessions within days after a natural disaster strikes.\n",
      "Project:Camp held three sessions in Northern California and Nevada this year during the West's historic wildfire season, which has consumed more than 3 million acres across a dozen states.\n",
      "“Camp is a healing space,” he said. “They show up at the beginning of the day quiet and reserved, and at the end of the day it’s actually hard to peel them away. They want to be with their friends.”\n",
      "Counselors at Project:Camp don’t coax children to discuss their trauma, instead allowing them to explore whatever feelings might arise throughout the day. Each session includes a “gratitude circle,” where children are invited to give thanks. The answers range from benign to telling.\n",
      "During one session earlier this summer, a boy said he was grateful for his house and then suddenly burst into tears. While firefighters were able to save the camper’s home from the Beckwourth Complex Fire, other children had lost theirs. The camper was filled with sadness and guilt after realizing his friends had not been spared.\n",
      "“We don’t break up moments like that, but we do try to facilitate a sensitive environment,” said David Baron, communications director for Project:Camp. “Kids are naturally really good at it.”\n",
