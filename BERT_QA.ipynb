      "WorldNumber of wildfires to rise by 50% by 2100 and governments are not prepared, experts warn Nairobi, 23 February, 2022    Climate change and land use change are projected to make wildfires more frequent and intense, with a global increase of extreme fires of up to 14 per cent by 2030, 30 per cent by the end of 2050 and 50 per cent by the end of the century, according to a new report by the UN Environment Programme  and GRID Arendal.The paper calls for a radical change in government spending on wildfires, shifting their investments from reaction and response to prevention and preparedness.The report, Spreading like Wildfire: The Rising Threat of Extraordinary Landscape Fires, finds an elevated risk even for the Arctic and other regions previously unaffected by wildfires.The report is released before the resumed 5^th^ session of the UN Environment Assembly  convenes in Nairobi, between 28 February and 2 March, 2022.The publication calls on governments to adopt a new 'Fire Ready Formula', with two thirds of spending devoted to planning, prevention, preparedness, and recovery, with one third left for response.Currently, direct responses to wildfires typically receive over half of related expenditures, while planning receives less than one per cent.To prevent fires, authors call for a combination of data and science based monitoring systems with indigenous knowledge and for a stronger regional and international cooperation.Current government responses to wildfires are often putting money in the wrong place.Those emergency service workers and firefighters on the frontlines who are risking their lives to fight forest wildfires need to be supported, said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director.We have to minimize the risk of extreme wildfires by being better prepared: invest more in fire risk reduction, work with local communities, and strengthen global commitment to fight climate change. 294\n"
