0,'We're one cigarette away': Illegal weed farms are a wildfire risk in parched California,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fire-guns-poison-illegal-marijuana-farms-pose-deadly-risks-californias-rcna7153,Thu Dec 02 2021 01:40:21 GMT+0000 (UTC),"LAKE ELSINORE, Calif. — After a 21⁄2-mile trek through thick brush, Mourad Gabriel stepped into a small clearing. A month earlier, this half-acre swath of the Cleveland National Forest, nearly invisible from the air, had been an illegal marijuana grow estimated to be worth more than $1.2 million. The U.S. Forest Service’s law enforcement officers had hacked down the plants, but Gabriel and his team were there to cart out nearly 3,000 pounds of trash and to clean up something else the drug traffickers left behind: poison. Gabriel, a regional wildlife ecologist for the Forest Service, spooned swabs of pesticide into a military-grade testing device to identify chemicals used by illicit farmers, which kill the forest’s wildlife. Recalling a past bust, he said: “We had a dead bear, a turkey vulture that was dead consuming that bear, and then another turkey vulture that was dead consuming that turkey vulture and that bear.“We call it ‘The circle of death.’”But another looming danger to animals — and to the human residents of one of the most populous areas in America — is fire. Just over the mountains from this grow is the sprawl of greater Los Angeles and its 19 million people. Advocates estimate that California’s national forests, four of which ring the Los Angeles basin, are home to 80 percent to 85 percent of the country’s illegal marijuana grows on public land. Every time traffickers start a grow on California’s drought-stricken federal forests, they put millions of people at risk. They use scarce water and sometimes set bone-dry woodlands ablaze. At least 13 wildfires in the past dozen years have been linked to grows.The Forest Service has long struggled to keep up — the agency has about one law enforcement officer for every 300,000 acres of forest — but since the coronavirus pandemic started, it has gotten even harder.In the past two years alone, grow operations in California have rerouted millions of gallons of water, caused a 125,000-acre wildfire in Big Sur and helped add at least one species to the endangered list. “This is an abuse of the natural resources and the land that we as an agency are stewarding for the public,” Gabriel said.The marijuana cultivation season coincides with the peak of wildfire season, diverting officers who would be targeting the grows into investigating the blazes, supporting firefighters and evacuating civilians.But sometimes those missions overlap. Last year’s 125,000-acre Dolan Fire was started by a marijuana grower in the Los Padres National Forest.“It burned through an iconic international landscape — Big Sur. It killed 11 endangered condors,” said Rich McIntyre, the director of the Cannabis Removal on Public Lands Project, or the CROP Project, a coalition advocating for more resources to reclaim grow sites and catch growers. “It overran firefighters. I mean, it’s just a nightmare.”Because marijuana cultivators live at their grow sites for months at a time, they introduce hazards like cigarettes, open-flame stoves and wood fires to highly combustible forestland. The CROP Project has identified at least 13 wildfires across California in the past 12 years caused by people associated with grow sites. NBC News was able to independently document half a dozen of them. From a 12,000-acre fire in 2014 caused by sparks from the tailpipe of a vehicle driving to a grow site to a much larger conflagration in 2009, fires associated with illegal grows have burned at least 275,000 acres across California.The Forest Service estimates that the true toll is far higher, as the origins of wildfires can be difficult to investigate and confirm. Many of the pesticides that drug traffickers use, meanwhile, are so poisonous that they have been outlawed in the U.S. for decades. “These are some of the most toxic chemicals you could ever use on crops,” said Greta Wengert, the executive director of the Integral Ecology Research Center, or IERC, a nonprofit organization that studies the impact of grow sites on the environment and assists the Forest Service in its cleanup efforts. Some of the biggest threats are the pesticides and rodenticides that growers spread to poison animals that threaten their plants or campsites. The chemicals are so toxic, Wengert said, and used in such high concentrations that a number of officers and cleanup workers have been hospitalized for exposure.“You take a little bit of carbofuran here: couple drops, mix it with some tuna fish, put it on the edge of your grow, an animal comes in, eats it and dies within two minutes,” Wengert said. “There’s your poison bomb, right there.”That’s especially problematic because IERC’s research has shown how the deadly, illegal chemicals work their way up the food chain as animals feed on one another. “It’s passed on again and again,” Wengert said. The Cleveland National Forest site is home to both the endangered Arroyo toad and the endangered California condor. But Wengert is also concerned about how the chemicals might be ingested by people — whether in the marijuana they consume or from runoff into water supplies. Through snowmelt and other sources, national forests provide 50 percent of the state’s water. The Cleveland Forest site sits in a watershed that runs directly into the water supply of San Juan Capistrano, a city of 36,000. Wengert’s group is studying downstream exposure, and in several cases, has confirmed the presence of toxic chemicals in waterways immediately downstream of grow sites.“The next significant precipitation event is just going to slough all this off into the San Juan Creek,” said Gabriel, the wildlife ecologist, running the grow site’s loose soil through his fingers. “That creek right below us is going to not just contaminate critical habitat for the Arroyo Toad, but it’s going to go downstream to San Juan Capistrano.”Typically run by drug-trafficking organizations, an average grow site may have 2,000 plants and yield hundreds to thousands of pounds of marijuana worth millions. New strains have allowed traffickers to get more product per plant, making grows even more profitable, according to law enforcement. And losing a few sites a year to busts by the Forest Service is just the cost of doing business, said Special Agent in Charge Don Hoang, who heads Forest Service law enforcement for the region. ""It’s a rule of probability. If they grow as many [sites] as they can, they know that we’re going to find a few of them. And then there’s stuff that we don’t find, and that’s where they make their profit.”Setting up a grow site isn’t cheap. It takes time, planning and money to bring in the infrastructure and labor — from miles of irrigation pipe to thousands of pounds of fertilizers and armed workers who live at the grow site all season long. “One drug traffic organization can invest, let’s say, a quarter-million, a half-million dollars into one grow. And then pull out a 200 percent to 300 percent net gain from that,” Gabriel said. “I don’t think anybody’s investment portfolio could ever do that.”While some grow sites may be hiding just a mile or so off a main highway, others can take officers days to reach. Growers are typically armed, Hoang said, and they often have a tactical advantage when law enforcement comes in to try to break up their operation.The Forest Service’s law enforcement division has arrested more than 2,170 people for cultivating marijuana on national forest land in California since 2000. The Forest Service and partner agencies bust more than 200 such sites on public lands annually, but cleanups, like the one in Cleveland National Forest, are expensive. The team at the Cleveland National Forest site pulled out nearly a ton and a half of trash on one day in October, more than a mile of irrigation piping, 1,110 pounds of fertilizer and bottle after bottle of banned pesticide, removing much of the bulkier material from the forest by helicopter. It is one of more than 40 sites cleaned up on national forest land in California alone this year, at an average cost of $40,000 per site — before hazardous material disposal. But that’s just a drop in the bucket, Gabriel said. There are hundreds of sites a year spread across California’s 20 million acres of national forest alone — the Forest Service simply doesn’t have enough resources to tackle every one. There is no dedicated funding for the operations; the agency’s overall law enforcement budget has stayed about the same size for most of the last decade.“In reality, we need 20.2 to 23.2 million [dollars] for five to eight years to fully address the topic in California alone,” Gabriel said. “Essentially, we put in only 10 to 12 percent of what is truly needed annually.”The technology to detect sites has improved over time, but the agency estimates that in a given year it detects about half of the sites on its land. And of the sites the agency detects, about a quarter are able to keep operating unhindered because the agency doesn’t have the resources to bust them before the traffickers harvest. The agency identifies dozens of grow sites annually that it is unable to get to before harvest.Overall, arrests for the grow sites have been on the decline since 2008, and the number of grow sites and plants eradicated in California’s national forests has dropped steeply in the past five years.With the proper resources, Gabriel said, the agency could eliminate marijuana grows within the next eight years. “We have the will to do this, and we’re ready to do this,” he said. “We leave them dirt, they don’t come back.”According to the Forest Service, once a grow site has been cleaned up and restored to its natural state, growers tend not to come back. That’s why increasing funding for the cleanup efforts is so important, said McIntyre of the CROP Project.“They need a lot more juice. They need a lot more people. And they need funding to actually see this through,” said McIntyre, whose coalition includes lawmakers of both parties, scientists, law enforcement officials, environmentalists and legal marijuana organizations. “Without substantial funding, it’s whack-a-mole.”Some of the additional funding may soon be on its way. The infrastructure bill President Joe Biden signed last month included a substantial increase in Forest Service funding to fight and prevent wildfires. The House also increased money for the agency in its annual spending bill, with the Appropriations Committee specifically expressing support in its accompanying report for agency efforts to detect and remove the sites, but the Senate has yet to do the same. Bipartisan members of California’s House delegation have also proposed a bill that would increase criminal penalties for stealing water from federal lands.The alternative is dire, McIntyre said. “We are one campfire, one dropped cigarette, one getaway fire in a trespass grow away from a landscape fire that could burn a million acres. And when that happens, we lose that public resource for an entire generation.”Adiel Kaplan is a reporter with the NBC News Investigative Unit.Kenzi Abou-Sabe is a reporter and producer in the NBC News Investigative Unit.Cynthia McFadden is the senior legal and investigative correspondent for NBC News."

The Kruger Rock Fire broke out Tuesday morning after high winds knocked down a tree onto a power line, the Larimer County Sheriff's Office said. It became fully contained Saturday afternoon, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The fire near Estes Park, a town of around 6,000 residents approximately 50 miles northwest of Denver, spread quickly amid warmer-than-normal temperatures and drought conditions in much of Colorado and the West.The rugged terrain prevented firefighters from approaching by foot, prompting local officials to order a water drop by air. An air tanker pilot died in a crash while fighting the fire. The pilot, Marc Thor Olson, was attempting to drop fire suppressant over the Kruger Rock Fire when he alerted officials that conditions had become too turbulent to make the drop, according to the sheriff's office. Moments later, around 6:30 p.m., ground personnel heard the plane crash.""We extend our sincerest condolences to the friends and family of Mr. Olson,"" the sheriff’s office said in a statement.Initial conditions caused the fire to spread quickly. Officials ordered mandatory and voluntary evacuations, which were lifted Friday evening. There have been no reports of structure damage.

3,Thousands of giant sequoias killed in California wildfires,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/thousands-giant-sequoias-killed-california-wildfires-rcna6182,Fri Nov 19 2021 20:00:52 GMT+0000 (UTC),"LOS ANGELES — Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of giant sequoias this year, adding to a staggering two-year death toll that accounts for up to nearly a fifth of Earth’s largest trees, officials said Friday.Fires in Sequoia National Park and the surrounding national forest that also bears the trees’ name tore through more than a third of groves in California and torched an estimated 2,261 and 3,637 sequoias, which are the largest trees by volume. Fires in the same area last year killed an unprecedented 7,500 to 10,400 of the 75,000 trees that are only native in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range.Intense fires that burned hot enough and high enough to kill so many giant sequoias — trees once considered nearly fire-proof — put an exclamation point on the impact of climate change. The combination of a warming planet that has created hotter droughts and a century of fire suppression that choked forests with thick undergrowth have fueled blazes that have sounded the death knell for trees that date back to ancient civilizations.“The sobering reality is that we have seen another huge loss within a finite population of these iconic trees that are irreplaceable in many lifetimes,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. “As spectacular as these trees are we really can’t take them for granted. To ensure that they’re around for our kids and grandkids and great grandkids, some action is necessary.”California has seen its largest fires in the past five years, with last year setting a record for most acreage burned. So far, the second-largest amount of land has burned this year.After last year’s Castle and SQF Complex fires took officials by surprise by wiping out so many sequoias, extraordinary measures were taken to save the largest and oldest trees this year.The General Sherman tree — the largest living thing on earth — and other ancient trees that are the backdrop for photos that often fail to capture grandeur of the giant sequoias was wrapped in a foil blanket.A type of fire-retardant gel, similar to that used as absorbent in baby’s diapers, was dropped on tree canopies that can exceed 200 feet (60 meters) in height. Sprinklers watered down trunks and flammable matter was raked away from trees.The measures spared the Giant Forest, the premiere grove of ancient trees in the park, but the measures couldn’t be deployed everywhere.The bulk of the Suwanee grove in the park burned in an extreme fire in the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River drainage. The Starvation Complex grove in Sequoia National Forest was largely destroyed, based on estimates of how much of it burned at high-severity.In 2013, the park had done climate modeling that predicted extreme fires wouldn’t jeopardize sequoias for another 50 years, said Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science at the two parks. But that was at the start of what became a punishing five-year drought that essentially broke the model.Amid the drought in 2015, the park saw giant sequoias torched for the first time. Two fires in 2017 killed more giant sequoias, serving as a warning for what was to come.“Then the Castle Fire happened and it was like, ‘Oh, my God,’” Brigham said. “We went from the warning sign to hair on fire. To lose 7,000 trees in one fire is crazy.”A full mortality count from last year’s fire is still not available because crews in the forest were in the process of confirming how many trees died when lightning struck Sept. 9, igniting the Windy Fire in Sequoia National Forest and the SQF Complex in the park, Brigham said.Not all the news from the estimates was bleak.While fire burned into 27 groves and large numbers of trees were incinerated, a lot of low-intensity fire that sequoias need to thrive cleared out vegetation and the heat will open cones so they can spread their seeds.Areas, however, where fire burned so hot and seeds were killed, may not be able to regenerate. For the first time, the park is considering planting seedlings to preserve the species.“I’m not ready to give up on giant sequoias,” Brigham said."

Two of the fires, which were caught quickly, were set behind fire lines where crews were fighting the Dixie Fire and could have trapped them had they grown, prosecutors have said.The other two fires were contained at between 200 square feet and less than one acre, according to court documents.A public defender listed as representing Maynard did not immediately return a request for comment late Thursday.Court documents do not appear to detail a motive. Maynard, who was arrested in August, denied setting any fires to investigators, according to documents. Maynard has, at times, been an adjunct faculty member and part-time lecturer Santa Clara University and Sonoma State University, but not recently, the universities have said. At the time of the arsons, he was living in his car, according to court documents. He faces up to 20 years in prison on each count of arson, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.The Dixie Fire would become the second largest in recorded state history, burning more than 963,000 acres. The fire started on July 13 and was fully contained on Oct. 25, according to fire officials. The cause is under investigation.Phil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News."

9,Ex-yoga teacher accused of arson in destructive Northern California blaze,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/destructive-fast-moving-california-wildfire-may-be-arson-not-natural-n1280208,Tue Sep 28 2021 02:21:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"Authorities in Northern California last week announced the arrest of a woman who they say ignited a wind-whipped wildfire that quickly tore through steep, rugged terrain, destroying 144 buildings, prompting the evacuation of thousands of people and becoming one of the state's more destructive blazes this year.The woman, Alexandra Souverneva, 30, a onetime yoga teacher from the San Francisco Bay Area whom a former colleague recalled as ""brilliant,"" is among more than 100 people who have been accused of wildland arson and arrested this year by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.The charge alleges a rare but significant act that has come into sharper focus as parched, overgrown forests explode across thousands of acres in days.""It is difficult to grasp when disaster like this is, apparently, not a natural disaster, but we have a suspect, and this might be an arson case,"" Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said during a community meeting Saturday.Souverneva has pleaded not guilty.Wildfires are usually accidental, ignited by damaged power lines, vehicles and logging equipment, said Ed Nordskog, a retired arson investigator with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and a co-author of ""Arson Investigation in the Wildlands.""While most wildfire agencies attribute about 10 percent of blazes to arson, Nordskog said the real number could be twice as high — a result of decades of officials' prioritizing suppression over investigations.""If you don't send an investigator, you don't have arson,"" he said.The intentional setting of a wildland fire can have swift, profound consequences. As Nordskog put it: ""They literally have the power of an atomic bomb at their fingertips. They can burn an entire town down if the conditions are right.""In 2006, for instance, a wind-driven blaze burned across 40,000 acres in Southern California, destroying dozens of homes and killing five firefighters. Raymond Oyler, a mechanic from Riverside County, was convicted of arson and murder and sentenced to death.In 2008, a former volunteer firefighter from Northern California, Robert Eason, was convicted of setting a dozen fires north of Sacramento, including one that burned 1,000 acres and killed 200 sheep. Investigators said Eason used a sophisticated time-delay device to ignite the fires.Unlike urban arsonists, whose ages, genders and races vary, wildland arsonists tend to be middle-age men, said Nordskog, who also wrote ""The Arsonist Profiles: Analyzing Arson Motives and Behavior."" Although lighters and matches are the preferred methods of ignition, some people, like Eason, use time-delay devices, such as matches wrapped around a cigarette, he said.""When they burst into flames, they're seven to 15 miles away,"" Nordskog said.Although some arsonists act for thrills, Nordskog said, anger, frustration and mental illness are more common motives. Just as common is how daunting the investigations can be. They're often in remote areas, with ignition points that could be devastated as firefighters work to extinguish the blazes, he said.Fire officials said Souverneva was arrested Wednesday night after she emerged from the brush near a fire line northeast of Redding in Shasta County. She had a working lighter in her pocket, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said Friday, and told firefighters that she was dehydrated and needed medical treatment.According to a Cal Fire report obtained by the Record Searchlight of Redding, Souverneva said she was hiking to Canada and tried to boil water that she found in a puddle. Her attempts failed, the report said, but she drank the water anyway — she believed it was mixed with bear urine — then walked uphill and saw smoke and airplanes “dropping pink stuff.”Souverneva was taken into custody on suspicion of arson.Because of a declared state of emergency, Souverneva faces an enhanced sentence of nine years if she is convicted, Bridgett said. She said authorities are ""aware"" of other fires locally and around the state that Souverneva ""may be linked to."" Bridgett declined to provide additional details.Bridgett, who also declined to discuss a possible motive, said there was no indication that Souverneva was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Nor did she appear mentally ill, Bridgett said, although witnesses who saw her earlier said she was acting ""irrationally,"" Cal Fire said in a statement.Souverneva pleaded not guilty to felony arson. Her attorney, Shana Vegvary, said that Souverneva was ""asserting her innocence"" and that ""no evidence has been presented to the contrary.""""We request that the public not prejudge this case,"" she said.Relatives in the Bay Area did not respond to requests for comment. A former colleague and instructor who taught Souverneva at Avalon Yoga International, in Palo Alto, recalled her as a brilliant student who attended the California Institute of Technology and worked for pharmaceutical companies before she burned out on ""big money-grubbing corporations.""""I thought she was an idealistic kid,"" said Steve Farmer, the chief executive of Avalon. ""She was into conservation and forests.""Farmer said he hadn't seen her since the pandemic started, when Avalon closed, although he planned to rehire her after it reopened. ""She would have been the last person I would have thought to get involved in something like this,"" he said.As of Monday, the fire in Shasta County had destroyed dozens of homes and grown to nearly 9,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. Firefighters had surrounded half of the blaze with containment lines.Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."

""We have a responsibility in California to get things done because we are the tip of the spear.""The climate package includes $5.2 billion for drought response and resilience, $3.7 billion for urban greening projects and coastal protection efforts, and $3.9 billion to fast-track the state's goal of switching to all zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.Newsom also approved nearly $1 billion in new spending to prevent wildfires, signaling a policy shift in a state that historically focused more on putting out fires than stopping them before they start.California spent $3.4 billion on wildfire protection last year, more than quadruple the level 15 years ago and a reflection of the reality that wildfires are getting bigger and more destructive from climate change. Six of the state's 10 largest wildfires have happened in the past two years.But state officials have spent the vast majority of that money on extinguishing fires, a job that has become harder as the fires have gotten bigger and hotter. This year, Newsom and the state Legislature agreed to dramatically increase spending on prevention.The initial outlay was about $500 million, but with a record-breaking budget surplus they were able to add nearly $1 billion more for a total of $1.5 billion.“Conditions have never been more challenging,” Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, said. “Expanding our upfront proactive actions is essential to address the wildfire risks we now face.”Scientists have long warned that the weather will get wilder as the world warms. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years.Most of the wildfire prevention money will pay for things like clearing brush and dead trees that act as kindling when fires start, causing them to quickly burn out of control before firefighters can contain them.There's money to hire inspectors to make sure newer homes built in the state's wildfire-prone areas comply with building codes requiring fire-resistant materials. And there's money for the state to intentionally set fires when conditions are right to burn away fuel that would otherwise help larger fires burn during the dry season.The money Newsom approved is the final piece of the state's $262.5 billion operating budget. The spending Newsom approved Thursday also includes $1.2 billion for things like water recycling projects, cleaning up contaminated water sources and grants to help communities plan for climate change.Republicans have criticized the spending because it does not include money for water storage projects, like building new reservoirs. California voters approved about $2.7 billion in 2014 for water storage projects. But so far, none of those have been built.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."
12,"Free, pop-up day camp becomes a home away from home for kids displaced by wildfires",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/camp-kids-traumatized-natural-disasters-offers-space-healing-n1279481,Sat Sep 18 2021 08:31:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"RENO, Nev. — When the Caldor Fire swooped down toward South Lake Tahoe in California, Melissa Benavidez and her family knew it was time to go.Her husband, a municipal firefighter, urged Benavidez to pack up their three children and head to safety while he stayed behind to work 12-hour shifts. Benavidez, a teacher, tried to make the experience fun for her family. They headed south to the Santa Cruz boardwalk and visited relatives in the San Joaquin Valley.Despite her best efforts, Benavidez’s children felt the stress of displacement and uncertainty.“They have been acting out quite a bit — fighting with each other constantly, lots of mental and emotional breakdowns,” she said. “They’re ready to be back to some normalcy.”Relief for the Benavidez family came about nine days into evacuation when a friend told them about a free, pop-up day camp created for children displaced by the Dixie and Caldor fires.For nearly two weeks in September, Project:Camp took up residency at the Terry Lee Wells Nevada Discovery Museum in Reno, a little more than an hour's drive from South Lake Tahoe.The camp welcomed dozens of children between the ages of 6 and 16, encouraging them to climb up a two-story jungle gym, splash about a model of the local Truckee River and explore the galaxy through an exhibit developed in collaboration with NASA. It also paired children with volunteer counselors trained in trauma-informed care, who were prepared to address emotional outbursts and help kids cope with the stress of evacuating or losing their homes.And it gave parents a much-needed respite during the day, providing space to contact insurance companies, stay updated on evacuation orders and process their own anxiety.“I haven’t had a lot of down time, but now I've been able to be by myself and go through my own emotions,” said Lindsey Simon, whose 8-year-old son spent a week at the camp.“When they’re in a setting like this, he gets tired at the end of the day so he’s calmer at home,” she added. “Otherwise, it’s just chaos and it’s not fun.”Natural disasters affect some 175 million children across the globe every year, triggering lasting consequences that can include anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. Chronic mental health problems have been observed in children up to four years after a major disaster, according to a 2015 study published in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry that looked at the long-term effects of hurricanes and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.Prolonged or repeated exposure to natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, flooding and even drought and heat waves, can also affect a child’s ability to learn. According to research published by the Society for Research in Child Development, trauma can change a child’s brain anatomy and function, making learning, memory and concentration more difficult for young people.“We know that kids are one of the most vulnerable populations when they experience natural disasters,” said Betty Lai, a professor of counseling, developmental and educational psychology at Boston College. “They really depend on adults to help them through these situations, but they also have fewer experiences to make sense of what it means when your world is turned upside down.”Each child reacts differently to traumatic events. Where one might act out for days or weeks, another might bounce back almost immediately. The difference often comes down to previous experiences and how parents are handling their own stress, according to Melissa Brymer, director of Terrorism and Disaster Programs at the UCLA–Duke National Center for Child Traumatic Stress.“It’s not about the numbers, but the severity and intensity of events,” she said. “A kid is going to be more impacted if they lose their home or lose a loved one.”This year, with dozens of wildfires raging at the same time as hurricanes, heat waves and the Covid-19 pandemic, families are forced to tackle multiple traumatic events simultaneously. Having a plan and sharing those preparations can help both parents and children manage the initial shock of being suddenly displaced, Brymer said.“Encourage kids to pack their stuff so they have comforting items,” she said. “Younger kids feed off their parents, and if parents are coping well in a disaster, that will help kids cope.”Giving both parents and children space to be themselves is one of the goals behind Project:Camp, according to its founder.It first originated in 2017 following Hurricane Harvey, which killed 68 people and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage. The hurricane forced the closure of daycare programs and camps throughout the area, compounding emergencies for parents who badly needed help with their children and time to figure out what to do next in the midst of a two-week disaster.Mikey Latner, founder and executive director of Project:Camp, was part of a national camp network when Hurricane Harvey hit. When colleagues in Texas put out an alert for help caring for children displaced by the hurricane, Latner flew from California to Texas to run logistics at a pop-up camp in Houston.During that hurricane, Latner helped feed some 350 children. The experience stayed with him, leading to a similar but smaller camp several months later during the Tubbs Fire in Northern California and then again in 2018 during the Woolsey Fire in Southern California.Latner hopes to eventually make Project:Camp national with the goal of setting up sessions within days after a natural disaster strikes.Project:Camp held three sessions in Northern California and Nevada this year during the West's historic wildfire season, which has consumed more than 3 million acres across a dozen states.“Camp is a healing space,” he said. “They show up at the beginning of the day quiet and reserved, and at the end of the day it’s actually hard to peel them away. They want to be with their friends.”Counselors at Project:Camp don’t coax children to discuss their trauma, instead allowing them to explore whatever feelings might arise throughout the day. Each session includes a “gratitude circle,” where children are invited to give thanks. The answers range from benign to telling.During one session earlier this summer, a boy said he was grateful for his house and then suddenly burst into tears. While firefighters were able to save the camper’s home from the Beckwourth Complex Fire, other children had lost theirs. The camper was filled with sadness and guilt after realizing his friends had not been spared.“We don’t break up moments like that, but we do try to facilitate a sensitive environment,” said David Baron, communications director for Project:Camp. “Kids are naturally really good at it.”Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."
13,World's largest tree wrapped in fire-resistant blanket due to threat of California wildfires,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/world-s-largest-tree-wrapped-fire-resistant-blanket-due-threat-n1279420,Fri Sep 17 2021 11:19:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"THREE RIVERS, Calif. — Firefighters wrapped the base of the world’s largest tree in a fire-resistant blanket as they tried to save a famous grove of gigantic old-growth sequoias from wildfires burning in California’s rugged Sierra Nevada.The colossal General Sherman Tree in Sequoia National Park’s Giant Forest, some other sequoias, the Giant Forest Museum and other buildings were wrapped for protection against the possibility of intense flames, fire spokeswoman Rebecca Paterson said.The aluminum wrapping can withstand intensive heat for short periods. Federal officials say they have been using the material for several years throughout the U.S. West to protect sensitive structures from flames. Near Lake Tahoe, some homes that were wrapped in protective material survived a recent wildfire while others nearby were destroyed.The Colony Fire, one of two burning in Sequoia National Park, was expected to reach the Giant Forest, a grove of 2,000 sequoias, at some point within days, fire officials said.However, the fire didn’t grow significantly Thursday as a layer of smoke reduced its spread in the morning, fire spokeswoman Katy Hooper said.It comes after a wildfire killed thousands of sequoias, some as tall as high-rises and thousands of years old, in the region last year.The General Sherman Tree is the largest in the world by volume, at 52,508 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters), according to the National Park Service. It towers 275 feet (84 meters) high and has a circumference of 103 feet (31 meters) at ground level.Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks Superintendent Clay Jordan stressed the importance of protecting the massive trees from high-intensity fire during a briefing for firefighters.A 50-year history of using prescribed burns — fires set on purpose to remove other types of trees and vegetation that would otherwise feed wildfires — in the parks’ sequoia groves was expected to help the giant trees survive by lessening the impact if flames reach them.A “robust fire history of prescribed fire in that area is reason for optimism,” Paterson said. “Hopefully, the Giant Forest will emerge from this unscathed.”Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires — fueled by climate change — can overwhelm the trees.That happened last year when the Castle Fire killed what studies estimate were 7,500 to 10,600 large sequoias, according to the National Park Service.A historic drought and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.A national interagency fire management team took command of efforts to fight the 11.5-square-mile (30-square-kilometer) Paradise Fire and the 3-square-mile (8-square-kilometer) Colony Fire, which was closest to the grove. Operations to burn away vegetation and other fuel that could feed the flames were done in that area.The fires forced the evacuation of the park this week, and parts of the town of Three Rivers outside the main entrance remained evacuated.To the south, a fire on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument grew significantly overnight to more than 6 square miles (15 square kilometers), and crews had no containment of it, a Sequoia National Forest statement said.The Windy Fire, also started by lightning, has burned into part of the Peyrone Sequoia Grove in the national monument, and other groves were threatened.“Due to inaccessible terrain, a preliminary assessment of the fire’s effects on giant sequoia trees within the grove will be difficult and may take days to complete,” the statement said.The fire led the Tulare County Sheriff’s Office to warn the communities of Ponderosa, Quaking Aspen, Johnsondale and Camp Whitsett, a Boy Scouts camp, to be ready to evacuate if necessary.The wildfires are among the latest in a long summer of blazes that have scorched nearly 3,550 square miles (9,195 square kilometers) in California, destroying hundreds of homes.Crews had limited ground access to the Colony Fire and the extreme steepness of the terrain around the Paradise Fire prevented it completely, requiring extensive aerial water and flame-retardant drops on both fires. The two fires were being managed collectively as the KNP Complex."
14,'We've done everything we can': South Lake Tahoe begins road to recovery following Caldor Fire,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/we-ve-done-everything-we-can-south-lake-tahoe-begins-n1278886,Sun Sep 12 2021 08:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — The lake is no longer crystal clear and most of the businesses remain closed, but South Lake Tahoe is slowly, if cautiously, coming back to life in the shadow of the devastating Caldor Fire that has already claimed 800 homes.Fire officials remained on high alert this week as thunderstorms swept through the region this week, threatening to stymie containment efforts and slow down repopulation plans.Since it erupted Aug. 14, the wildfire has devoured more than 218,000 acres and destroyed a total of 1,000 structures in the Sierra Nevada. It was 65 percent as of Saturday, and some 10,000 people are still not able to return home.“This is the most tense it’s gotten this week,” Jaime Moore, spokesman for the California Incident Management Team at the Caldor Fire, said Thursday while standing outside Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Lake Tahoe, which serves as a makeshift command center for firefighters and emergency personnel.“We’ve done everything we can,"" he added.Throughout much of the area, residents posted signs and even an inflatable bear thanking firefighters and other emergency responders for protecting their homes. But a palpable frustration lingered in the air as community members wonder when they can return to their old lives in this quiet, mountain hamlet.""Fires were never a thing here,"" Jessie Marshall said of her hometown. ""We just keep getting fires and they get worse every year.""Marshall now lives in Medford, Oregon, and returned to the area earlier this week to visit loved ones, many of whom had to evacuate or help others flee their homes. This is the second wildfire she has experienced this summer. Earlier, the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon choked the air around her current home.On Thursday, as firefighters and National Guard members strolled through the Hard Rock lobby, Marshall played poker and sipped on a cocktail. She was one of a small handful of people inside the casino not associated with the fire response.About 10 minutes south at Regan Beach, retired postal worker George Ayers waded through the unusually cloudy waters of Lake Tahoe as his dog, Sonora, chased after a toy a few yards away.All around him, a heavy blanket of smoke camouflaged the once pristine lake with a gray and brown haze that made the water difficult to see even from just a few feet away.“This is one of the most beautiful places in the world and she’s not showing up today,” he said. “It just breaks my heart.”The sky turned yellow, black and red as the fire crept closer to the lake in the first days that the fire threatened the area, Ayers recalled.“It was like the world was on fire,” he said.Ayers is one of thousands of residents forced from their homes after the voracious Caldor Fire swept through three counties in Northern California. This week, it finally slowed and allowed fire officials to lift or downgrade evacuation orders for many of the 43,000 people who fled their homes with only a few minutes to gather their belongings.But the area is not out of danger yet as a warning for dangerous fire weather took effect for much of fire-scarred Northern California from Thursday afternoon through Friday. While the ongoing threat lingered, residents waited out both the fire and the passing storms from the safety of hotel rooms, evacuation shelters or the homes of loved ones.Across the state, nearly 15,000 firefighters have made progress on 14 major wildfires and several smaller new fires, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. They include three of the state’s 20 largest fires on record.Crews have faced historic drought, record temperatures and coronavirus outbreaks within fire camps. At the Caldor Fire, nine emergency responders have been injured, including one firefighter who sustained second- and third-degree burns throughout 20 percent of his body.On Thursday, firefighters hurried to clear and remove fire-weakened trees in hopes of allowing residents back into their homes as early as this weekend. It’s a slow and arduous process, and while residents say they are grateful for the firefighters' efforts, many people are yearning for normalcy.South Lake Tahoe resident Andres Delgadillo was forced to close his Mexican restaurant, Los Mexicanos, for a week and live with relatives in Vallejo, some three and a half hours away.The mandatory evacuation was ordered a week before Labor Day, a typically busy weekend for his restaurant. Instead, Delgadillo closed his business, created a WhatsApp chat for his employees and monitored conditions from afar.“There were police, there were firefighters with loudspeakers around the neighborhoods,” he said. “I tried to come back for my medicine but I was told to stay away.”When he returned a week later, Delgadillo had to throw out food and other perishable goods from his restaurant and the neighboring market that he also owns. Because some of his employees are still under evacuation orders, he is filling in for five of them.“Thankfully this summer was really busy,” he said of his business. “Hopefully we’ll be OK, but you never know. We were able to put a little [money] aside.Meyers resident Sean Griffins, who works for South Lake Tahoe Refuse, is one of the few residents who can access his house throughout the day because he is considered an essential worker. On Thursday afternoon, he loaded clean laundry into his car and prepared to head back to the hotel room he is sharing with his wife and two dogs.“We’ve had to clean up because the bears had a good time for a couple of days,” he said. “Last week, there was trash all up and down the street. They just destroyed everything.”Just a few hours later, fire officials reduced evacuation orders in Meyers and residents were allowed to return home.For Ayers, who evacuated his home in nearby Christmas Valley on Aug. 29, the waiting game is both frustrating and pricey. He and his dog have been living out of a hotel for nearly two weeks with just each other for company.He had about 15 minutes to throw some clothes into large trash bags and flee his home of 21 years. All he could think about is what would come next.“I’m 81 years old and I said, ‘Do I have to start over?’” he said. “I didn’t eat for three or four days until I realized I hadn’t eaten. Thank God for firefighters.”Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."
15,South Lake Tahoe residents can return as fire threat eases,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/south-lake-tahoe-residents-can-return-fire-threat-eases-n1278549,Mon Sep 06 2021 00:21:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — Tens of thousands of people forced to flee South Lake Tahoe could begin returning to their homes after evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings Sunday afternoon as crews made progress against a massive wildfire.The orders that sent 22,000 people in and around the resort fleeing last week were reduced to warnings as the fire virtually stalled a few scant few miles from the forest areas straddling the California-Nevada border.The threat from the Caldor Fire hasn't entirely vanished, but downgrading to a warning meant those who wish could return to their homes in what had been a smoke-choked ghost town instead of a thriving Labor Day getaway location.California Highway Patrol officers began taking down roadblocks on State Route 50 at Stateline, Nevada, KCRA-TV reported. Members of the National Guard who had helped on the fire had left the area.Mandatory evacuation orders on the Nevada side of the state line were lifted Saturday, although Douglas County authorities urged residents to stay alert, saying the fire still has the potential to threaten homes.The wind-driven fire, which at its peak had burned as much as 1,000 acres an hour in the northern Sierra Nevada, was mainly held within current containment lines overnight and was now 43 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.No homes had been lost on the eastern side of the fire nearest to the lake and crews managed to carve more fire line along one edge of a fiery finger, which hadn’t moved east, Tim Ernst, a fire operations chief, said at a morning briefing.“Everything has held real well” despite some flareups among timber and some hot spots in the west and southeastern sections of the nearly 340-square-mile blaze, Ernst said.Winds that drove the flames through tinder-dry trees, grass and granite outcroppings eased in recent days, and fire crews were able to double down on bulldozing, burning or hacking out fire lines.The fire that began on Aug. 14 has destroyed more than 700 home and injured nine firefighters and civilians, Cal Fire reported.California and much of the U.S. West have seen dozens of wildfires in the past two months as the drought-stricken region sweltered under hot, dry weather and winds drove flames through bone-dry vegetation.In California, nearly 14,500 firefighters were battling 13 large, active fires. Since the year began, more than 7,000 wildfires have devoured 3,000 square miles, Cal Fire said.No deaths had been reported specifically from the fires. However, authorities said two people assigned to fire-related duties died from illness this week, officials said.Marcus Pacheco, an assistant fire engine operator for Lassen National Forest with 30 years of experience, died on Thursday. He was assigned to the Dixie Fire burning north of the Caldor Fire, authorities said. Other details weren’t immediately released.The Dixie Fire began in mid-July in the northern Sierra Nevada and is the second-largest wildfire in recorded state history. It has burned nearly 1,400 square miles in five counties and three national parks and forests, according to Cal Fire.A retired firefighter who was hired to help with the French Fire died from complications of Covid-19, authorities said. He was identified as Allen Johnson.“Our team, the firefighting community and the world lost a great friend, mentor, teacher and comrade last night,” said a Facebook posting last Wednesday from California Interagency Incident Management Team 14.The French Fire in Kern County was 52 percent contained after burning about 41 square miles.Fire concerns have shut down all national forests in the state.California has experienced increasingly larger and deadlier wildfires in recent years as climate change has made the West much warmer and drier over the past 30 years. Scientists have said weather will continue to be more extreme and wildfires more frequent, destructive and unpredictable."

""It's a fresh burn, and if we get it steered into there ... that basically stops the spread of fire. It's a very valid tactic that we're trying to do.""The Tamarack Fire, which was sparked by lightning on July 4, spans nearly 70,000 acres across Alpine County in California and Douglas County in Nevada. It was 82 percent contained as of Tuesday.Residents in parts of Douglas County, Nevada, were under evacuation orders Tuesday evening as the Caldor Fire continued its destructive march east. They were instructed to turn off sprinkler systems before leaving their homes amid worsening drought conditions across the West.""Conserving water NOW will help ensure water supply is available if needed,"" county officials tweeted.The Caldor Fire has already scorched more than 191,000 acres as of Tuesday and is 16 percent contained. At least three firefighters and two civilians have been injured since the blaze started nearly three weeks ago.Earlier Tuesday, the ferocious wildfire continued its rampage toward a popular vacation destination just hours after roads were clogged with fleeing cars when the entire California resort city of South Lake Tahoe was ordered to evacuate and communities just across the state line in Nevada were warned to get ready to leave.About 700 structures have been destroyed and more than 30,000 remain threatened. Law enforcement officials are working closely with fire crews and the California and Nevada national guards to oversee evacuation efforts and keep a close eye on property.More than 15,000 firefighters were battling dozens of California blazes, including crews from Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia, said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. About 250 active-duty soldiers were being trained in Washington state to help with the arduous work of clearing forest debris by hand.Crews from Louisiana, however, had to return to that state because of Hurricane Ida, “another major catastrophic event taking place in the country and is a pull on resources throughout the United States,” he said.""We are using all of our resources, everything that we have at our disposal,"" Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday.He and California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared states of emergencies Monday in advance of the fire's persistent march toward Lake Tahoe. Newsom, who is facing a recall, signed a separate order allowing out-of-county firefighters and other emergency workers to cast their ballots for the Sept. 14 election.""We thank all the heroic firefighters and first responders working around the clock to combat this rapidly spreading fire and to protect local communities across California this fire season,"" Newsom said in a statement.Lake Tahoe, a popular vacation haven normally filled with tens of thousands of summer tourists, emptied out Monday as the massive Caldor Fire rapidly expanded. Vehicles loaded with bikes and camping gear and hauling boats were in gridlocked traffic, stalled in hazy, brown air that smelled like a campfire. Police and other emergency vehicles whizzed by.“It's more out of control than I thought,” evacuee Glen Naasz said of the fire that by late Monday had been pushed by strong winds across California highways 50 and 89, burning mountain cabins as it swept down slopes into the Tahoe Basin.Ken Breslin was stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic less than a mile from his home in the city of 22,000, with only a quarter-tank of gas in his Ford Escape. His son begged him to leave Sunday night, but he shrugged him off, certain that if an evacuation order came, it would be later in the week.“Before, it was, ‘No worries ... it’s not going to crest. It’s not gonna come down the hill. There’s 3,500 firefighters, all those bulldozers and all the air support,’” he said. “Until this morning, I didn’t think there was a chance it could come into this area. Now, it’s very real.”Monday’s fresh evacuation orders, unheard of in the city, came a day after communities several miles south of the lake were abruptly ordered to leave as the fire raged nearby. South Lake Tahoe’s main medical facility, Barton Memorial Hospital, proactively evacuated dozens of patients, and the El Dorado Sheriff’s Office transferred inmates to a neighboring jail.“There is fire activity happening in California that we have never seen before. The critical thing for the public to know is evacuate early,” said Chief Thom Porter, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. “For the rest of you in California: Every acre can and will burn someday in this state.”The threat of fire is so widespread that the U.S. Forest Service announced Monday that all national forests in California would be closed until Sept. 17.Porter said that only twice in California history have blazes burned from one side of the Sierra Nevada to the other, both this month, with the Caldor and Dixie fires. The Dixie, the second-largest wildfire in state history at 1,205 square miles about 65 miles north of the Lake Tahoe-area blaze, prompted new evacuation orders and warnings Monday.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

Residents and visitors were told to evacuate east on Highway 50 toward Nevada as the Caldor Fire raged nearby, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection announced on social media.By Monday night, the fire had crossed state highways 50 and 89 and burned mountain cabins as it churned down slopes toward the Tahoe Basin.The Caldor Fire has proved so difficult to fight that fire managers pushed back the projected date for full containment from early this week to Sept. 8. But even that seemed optimistic.The governor's office said Monday that nearly 30,000 people had been evacuated from El Dorado County, where the Caldor Fire is burning. It was unclear whether the figure included South Lake Tahoe numbers.NBC Los Angeles reported that vehicles loaded with bikes and camping gear, some hauling boats, snaked through thick, brown air that smelled of fire. Police and other emergency vehicles sped by.""This is a systematic evacuation, one neighborhood at a time,"" South Lake Tahoe police Lt. Travis Cabral said on social media. ""I am asking you as our community to please remain calm.""South Lake Tahoe Police Chief David Stevenson said there were tense moments Monday, and he acknowledged the traffic that jammed on a highway getting out.""I'm so appreciative that our citizens listened to the warning and the order and evacuated the city,"" Stevenson said at a news conference later that day.Communities several miles south of the lake were abruptly ordered to evacuate Sunday, NBC Los Angeles reported.Flames moved through mountains Sunday just a few miles southwest of the Tahoe Basin, where thick smoke sent tourists packing at a time when vacations would typically be in full swing ahead of the Labor Day weekend.The Caldor Fire, which broke out Aug. 14, has burned more than than 291 square miles — an area larger than Chicago — as of Monday night, fire officials said. It was 15 percent contained.At least 482 homes have been destroyed, and more than 33,600 structures were threatened, state department of forestry and fire protection, known as Cal Fire, said.The terrain is making the fire difficult to contain, officials said.Some areas of the Northern California terrain are so rugged that crews had to carry fire hoses by hand from Highway 50 as they sought to douse spot fires caused by erratic winds.The threat of wildfires prompted the U.S. Forest Service to temporarily close all national forests in California. The closure begins at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday and goes through Sept. 17, including Labor Day weekend.""We do not take this decision lightly but this is the best choice for public safety,” Regional Forester Jennifer Eberlien said in a statement Monday.Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday declared a state of emergency for the additional counties of Alpine, Amador and Placer because of the Caldor Fire.Antonio Planas is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.

21,California wildfire dangers may be spreading south,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-wildfire-dangers-may-be-spreading-south-n1277672,Thu Aug 26 2021 10:59:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"LOS ANGELES — A wildfire that burned several homes near Los Angeles may signal that the region is facing the same dangers that have scorched Northern California.The fire in San Bernardino County erupted Wednesday afternoon, quickly burned several hundred acres and damaged or destroyed at least a dozen homes and outbuildings in the foothills northeast of Los Angeles, fire officials said. Crews used shovels and bulldozers and mounted an air attack to keep the South Fire from the tiny communities of Lytle Creek and Scotland near the Cajon Pass.Some 600 homes and other buildings were threatened along with power transmission lines, and 1,000 residents were under evacuation orders.By nightfall, firefighters appeared to have gained the upper hand and few flames were to be seen. But the blaze was worrying because Southern California's high fire season is typically later in the year when strong, dry Santa Ana winds blast out of the interior and flow toward the coast.After a few cooler days, the southern region was expected to see a return of hot weather heading into the weekend. In addition to dangerously dry conditions, the region is faced with firefighting staffing that is increasingly stretched thin, said Lyn Sieliet, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino National Forest.“Some of our firefighters that we normally have on our forests are working on fires in Northern California, or Idaho and Washington,” she told KTLA-TV. “We don’t have the full staff that we normally do.”The largest fires in the state and in the nation were in Northern California, where they have burned down small mountain towns and destroyed huge swaths of tinder-dry forest.The Caldor Fire destroyed some 500 homes since Aug. 14 in the Sierra Nevada southwest of Lake Tahoe, including much of the tiny hamlet of Grizzly Flats. It was 12 percent contained and threatened more than 17,000 structures.Buck Minitch, a firefighter with the Pioneer Fire Protection District, was called to the fire lines last week while his wife fled their Grizzly Flats home with their two daughters, three dogs, a kitten and duffel bag of clothes, the San Jose Mercury News reported.Hannah Minitch evacuated to her parents' property and the next morning received a text from her husband showing only a chimney where their house once stood. The two briefly wept together during a telephone call before he got back to work.“‘We’ve got nothing left here,’” she recalled him saying. “'I’ve got to go protect what’s left for other people.'”At times the wind-driven fire was burning 1,000 acres of land per hour and on Wednesday it was less than two dozen miles from Lake Tahoe, an alpine vacation and tourist spot that straddles the California-Nevada state line.There weren't any evacuations in Tahoe but the fire continued to cast a sickly yellow pall of smoke over the scenic region.South Lake Tahoe and Tahoe City on the west shore had the nation’s worst air pollution at midmorning Wednesday, according to AirNow, a partnership of federal, state and local air agencies.Meanwhile, California’s Dixie Fire, the second-largest in state history at 1,160 square miles, was burning only about 65 miles to the north. It was 45 percent contained. Some 700 homes were among nearly 1,300 buildings that have been destroyed.In the southern Sierra Nevada, there was growing concern as the French Fire expanded near Lake Isabella, a popular fishing and boating destination. About 10 communities were under evacuation orders. The fire has blackened 32 square miles since Aug. 18.Smoke from the fires had fouled air farther south. The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued an advisory through Thursday morning for large portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.Nationally, 92 large fires were burning in 13 mainly Western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.Climate change has made the West warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists."
22,"California town had worst air quality in the world on Wednesday, report says",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-s-mountain-getaway-lake-tahoe-inundated-smoke-n1277665,Thu Aug 26 2021 01:59:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"The Lake Tahoe region, the pristine getaway for generations of visitors from California's urban coast, is in the midst of a big-city problem of its own: terrible air quality.The culprit is the 126,182-acre Caldor Fire to the south, and possibly spot fires from the 82 percent-contained Tamarack Fire, also to the south, officials said.Purple Air, a company that sells home air quality monitors and publishes regional results from the resulting virtual network, reported Wednesday that the area had the worst air quality in the world.The federal air-quality data site AirNow reported a U.S. Air Quality Index peak of 422 for South Lake Tahoe early Wednesday. That put the air near the freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the ""hazardous"" range.""It's some of the worst air we've seen there,"" said Amy MacPherson, spokeswoman for the California Air Resources Board.The last time the area experienced anything near this week's smoke, she said, was during the Rim Fire, which burned for weeks in late summer 2013.The state Office of Emergency Services warned Tahoe residents Wednesday to ""limit outdoor physical activity and stay indoors if possible.""MacPherson said a forecast of shifting winds could improve things by the weekend. The National Weather Service said in its forecast discussion Wednesday that air quality could improve by the end of the week, ""at least from a relative sense after the unhealthy to hazardous air quality that we have seen for what seems like ages.""The Caldor Fire, which started Aug. 14 in the Grizzly Flats area of El Dorado County, is the state's third-largest blaze. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Wednesday that it was 11 percent contained.Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday that the White House has approved a disaster declaration, which comes with federal funds, for nearly a dozen wildfires in California.Dennis Romero writes for NBC News and is based in Los Angeles."
23,Explosive California wildfire 'knocking on the door' of Tahoe area,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/explosive-california-wildfire-knocking-door-tahoe-area-n1277493,Tue Aug 24 2021 18:19:09 GMT+0000 (UTC),"An explosive California wildfire that has forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes and devastated a mountain community last week is “knocking on the door” of the Lake Tahoe basin, the state’s top fire official said Monday.The Caldor Fire, which has burned more than 117,000 acres over 10 days and remains 9 percent contained as of Tuesday, forced the closure of schools in the Washoe County School District and several flights in and out of the Reno-Tahoe International Airport.Intense smoke is also contributing to record-breaking hazardous air quality levels in the surrounding areas. On Monday, the Washoe County Health District – Air Quality Management Division issued an emergency warning after the air quality index, or AQI, for the Reno-Sparks area hit 291, up from 251 the day before. Air quality is expected to be “very unhealthy” to “hazardous” through Wednesday.Very Unhealthy to Hazardous air quality due to #CaldorFire smoke is continuing to impact Washoe County. #BeSmokeSmart everyone should be staying indoors and doing only light activity when inside.Yesterday beat Sunday's record for a 24-hr avg AQI. New record is 291 (was 251). pic.twitter.com/WXsJwXNIpsOn Monday, Thom Porter, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said the fire was the “No. 1 priority in the nation” for securing more resources to help stave off the damage it could inflict on the popular destination and region, which is home to tens of thousands of people.“It is that important,” Porter told reporters, adding: “We have all efforts to keep it out of the basin.”The blaze has destroyed 557 buildings, Cal Fire said. Last week, it incinerated much of Grizzly Flats, a small community 65 miles east of Sacramento.Eric Schwab, a Cal Fire section chief, said Monday that limiting the fire’s eastern spread toward Tahoe and small mountain communities was a “huge priority.” But firefighters were struggling to contain a spot fire in that section of the blaze that was quickly expanding, he said.More than 24,000 people remained under evacuation orders Monday in El Dorado County, where the fire ignited Aug. 14, according to the Governor’s Office of Emergency Management Services.Evacuees have flooded camp sites, churches and shelters as they wait to return to their homes.The blaze, which grew by more than 47,000 acres in less than 24 hours, jumped U.S. Route 50, the main thoroughfare through the Tahoe area.The fire is one of 12 large blazes burning across the state. A Cal Fire spokesman said Monday that a staggering 1.5 million acres have burned in California this year, a 42 percent jump from last year, when the most acres in modern history burned across the state. More than 14,000 firefighters are deployed across California as of Tuesday, according to Cal Fire.Experts have attributed the state’s increasingly intense fire seasons to a historic drought magnified by climate change and a century of fire suppression policies that built up dense forests that can act as kindling.Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."
24,Firefighters could get $600 million boost from Congress. It's probably not enough.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/firefighters-could-get-600-million-boost-congress-it-s-probably-n1277264,Tue Aug 24 2021 08:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"As large chunks of the Western U.S. burned over the summer, lawmakers in Washington quietly inserted measures into the massive infrastructure package that they hope can be almost as potent as water in fighting them: cash.The $1 trillion infrastructure bill the Senate passed this month included $600 million to raise the pay of federally employed firefighters and to create 1,000 more federal firefighting jobs.Experts say the funds are sorely needed to build a larger, better compensated force to fight fires that, because of climate change, will worsen in the coming years. At the same time, they say, it’s not nearly enough to tackle the intensifying infernos.“All the research we have shows this is going to be a century-long problem. That absolutely presents the dilemma that the measures in the Senate infrastructure bill, while nothing to sneeze at, are really nowhere close to enough,” said a wildfire policy expert, Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College.The bill, which still must be passed by the House and signed by President Joe Biden to become law, would allow the Agriculture and Interior departments — which oversee the two largest federal firefighting forces (one within the U.S. Forest Service and one within the Bureau of Land Management) — to switch 1,000 seasonal, contract firefighting jobs without benefits to full-time positions that offer benefits.The bill would also raise pay for the firefighter jobs in the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management by, on average, $20,000. In California, federal firefighter salaries start around $28,000, compared to about $66,000 for state firefighters.In addition, the bill would order the Agriculture and Interior departments to work with the Office of Personnel Management to begin reclassifying job descriptions for most federal firefighters, which could further raise pay for those jobs. The federal government would create a civil service job classification of wildland firefighters for those identified as forestry technicians.Separately, the White House this summer raised pay for federal wildland firefighters to make sure all were earning at least $15 an hour, boosting compensation for the majority of the Forest Service’s 14,500 wildland firefighters (who had made, on average, about $13 an hour).“Supporting our brave firefighters with pay, benefits and career opportunities that reflect the importance and danger of the work that they do is critical to facing the mounting wildfire threat,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement last week.Seven firefighters died fighting wildfires in 2019, the most recent year for which complete data are available, according to federal data.The additional funding would be a boon to California, in particular, where the vast majority of wildfires have burned this year and in years past.In California and other states across the West, wildfires are fought by a combination of crews from the federal, state and county levels. The command centers can shift from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, based on where a fire is burning at any one time, but the majority of firefighters during the region’s increasingly long “fire season” are employed at the federal level, experts said. Because nearly all wildfires in California start — and expand — on national forestlands, Forest Service firefighters are most often the first and most plentiful crews on the scene.“Our folks have been fighting fire for nearly two months now,” Tony Scardina, deputy regional forester for the Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest region, said Wednesday at a news conference with California officials. “They’re tired. They’re fatigued.”NBC News reported this month that certain squads of federal firefighters and related teams had been instructed to bring their own personal stashes of food, water and other supplies to last them three days.In California, where efforts by federal crews are augmented by the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, the Forest Service has scrambled in recent weeks to fill positions.In mid-July, nearly 20 percent of 4,620 planned permanent and temporary positions were unfilled in the Forest Service’s California region, the agency said. By Aug. 12, according to the agency, about 10 percent of those 4,620 positions remained vacant. The agency also said that it had to hire 2,229 more emergency firefighters and that only 31 of the region’s 44 “hotshot crews” — specialized groups dispatched to major fires — were fully staffed as of Aug. 12.As of Monday, 12 major fires had burned through more than 1.3 million acres in parts of the state — the earliest point on record that the state has surpassed 1 million acres burned. The largest fire is the Dixie Fire, in the Sierra Nevada range, which has burned through more than 724,000 acres and remains only 38 percent contained, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The Monument Fire in the north-central chunk of the state, which has burned through 148,000 acres, is only 20 percent contained. And the Caldor Fire exploded last week, expanding from 6,500 acres Tuesday morning to about 30,000 acres by the evening hours. It has burned through 104,000 acres and is only 5 percent contained, according to the fire center.Nationwide, nearly 4.6 million acres have burned as of Monday, compared to 3.6 million acres at the same point last year, according to fire center data.Scientists have long argued that wildfires worldwide are worsening because of broad environmental effects brought on by climate change, including hotter temperatures and historically long droughts. And as the Western U.S. gets hotter and more arid, the intensity, severity and frequency of wildfires are certain to continue rising.Experts and wildfire policy analysts say the latest federal efforts do too little to offer incentives to do the dangerous and underpaid work of fighting wildfires and to take action that could, in theory, prevent such rapid growth of wildfires.“Of course it’s a good start, and it’s important, but it’s not going to help solve the long-term issues one bit,” said Miller of Pomona College. “Agencies like the Forest Service burn through their budget just fighting fires, which means that whatever money that could have otherwise been used to help us get ahead of these fires ... is being consumed by the devastating fires of the moment.“Without more, whatever the federal government does to boost firefighter pay will go up in smoke, along with the land,"" he said.Adam Edelman is a political reporter for NBC News."

Lightning could spark new blazes even as crews try to surround a number of other forest fires that were ignited by lightning last month.Repopulation orders for several neighboring communities were canceled Friday “out of extreme caution to protect public safety” after spot fires erupted overnight, dashing any hopes of residents returning to their homes, according to the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office.That increased fire activity knocked out cellphone, internet and 911 service in Lassen County after a fiber optic cable was damaged, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Phone and internet service was restored as of Friday morning, but it remained unclear whether 911 service was back to normal, an interagency spokesperson said.“Crews worked all night, but there’s just a lot of fire,” Jake Cagle, the U.S. Forest Service operations section chief, said Friday at a news briefing.The Dixie Fire has already consumed nearly 518,000 acres across four counties, two national forests and one national park. It was 31 percent contained as of Friday. An estimated containment date is still weeks away, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.Friday’s forecast of heat, winds and lightning is “not going to help,” Cagle said. “This will be a challenge.""Residents near the fire were still trying to cope with the magnitude of their loss.“Everything that I own is now ashes or twisted metal. That’s just all it is,” said Greenville resident Ken Donnell, who escaped with just the clothes on his back.Donnell said he was heartbroken, but that “by God, I’m going to smile. Because you know, it just makes things a little bit better, and a little bit better right now is a lot.”Sam Prentice, a firefighter for the Forest Service, battled the flames in Greenville on Aug. 5, when the town was leveled. He was not optimistic on Greenville’s ability to rebuild.“Essentially it starts to become an archeology site — kind of a testament to the fire era that we’re in right now,” said Prentice. “It’s daunting.”The fire has ravaged more than 800 square miles (well over 2,000 square kilometers) — an area larger than London — and continued to threaten more than a dozen rural and forest communities.Earlier this week, fire officials warned of shrinking supplies for wildland firefighters arriving at fire camps. One memo instructed firefighters and incident management teams to bring a personal stash of food, water and other supplies to last them three days.A second memo warned that “due to the increased demand and numerous long duration fires,” communication equipment, including handheld radios and travel support, was “critically low.”The supply shortages were not expected to affect firefighters who are already stationed at incidents throughout the West.The two memos contributed to a dire picture of an already overburdened federal firefighting force facing increasingly difficult conditions on the ground.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."
31,'A completely different beast': Dangerous wildfire smoke linked to severe Covid cases,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/wildfire-smoke-could-raise-risk-severe-covid-death-study-finds-n1276752,Fri Aug 13 2021 18:10:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"Severe illnesses and deaths from Covid-19 spiked on the West Coast in the weeks after catastrophic wildfires raged across the region last year, a study published Friday finds.The increases in disease and death, the researchers say, appear to have been aggravated by the smoke that blanketed parts of California, Oregon and Washington during the 2020 wildfire season.Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe new research was published in the journal Science Advances as Covid-19 cases are once again surging — driven by the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus — and massive wildfires blaze across the West, sending plumes of smoke all the way to the Eastern Seaboard.Wildfire smoke contains microscopic particles that lodge in the deepest part of the lungs, where the oxygen exchange between the lungs and the blood occurs. That, along with the sheer density of the particles in wildfire smoke, makes the pollutant especially dangerous for respiratory health.To compare wildfire smoke exposure to Covid-19 cases, the authors of the study looked at daily levels of the microscopic particles from wildfire smoke in nearly 100 counties in California, Oregon and Washington during the 2020 wildfire season and compared them to Covid-19 cases and deaths in the same period, as well as the four weeks that followed. They found that the burst of air pollutants correlated with a spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths that lasted up to four weeks after the smoke had cleared.Some areas were covered in wildfire smoke for nearly one-third of the days from March to December. Butte County, California — where the Dixie Fire is raging — and Whitman County, Washington, had the sharpest spikes in Covid-19 cases following wildfire smoke pollution. The researchers estimated that wildfire smoke accounted for a nearly 20 percent increase in Covid-19 cases in each county.“When you look at each individual county, there’s the possibility that there are other factors, such as a lot of dust, that could also be contributing to the rise,” said a co-author, Kevin Josey, a postdoctoral research fellow in the biostatistics department at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University. “But when you aggregate so many counties together and see those effects across the region, the possibility of coincidence becomes much more muted.”Two earlier studies, one that focused on wildfire smoke pollution and Covid-19 cases in Orange County, California, and the other in Reno, Nevada, documented the same pattern.“About two weeks after we had these smoke exposure events, we saw an uptick in the Covid-19 incidents, even in a low-density pollution area, that were beyond what you would have predicted normally. And then as the smoke dissipated, the peak went back down,” said Michael Kleinman, a co-director of the Air Pollution Health Effects Laboratory at the University of California, Irvine, who co-wrote the Orange County study. “This happened three times with three different smoke exposures.”Sarah Henderson, scientific director of Environmental Health Services at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, said: “Wildfire smoke is so vastly different from the air pollution in urban areas or around industrial facilities that we usually talk about. It’s not another form of air pollution. It’s a completely different beast.”That’s because, unlike the relatively predictable emissions from car or industry pollution, wildfire smoke changes constantly and the duration and amount of exposure really varies, she said. Wildfire smoke is also dense and can quickly increase fine particulate matter in the air twentyfold.Kleinman said a growing body of evidence points to an association between wildfire smoke and susceptibility to Covid-19, although more research is needed to pin down whether there’s a direct link.“The research does indicate that the particulate matter and toxic chemicals that are associated with wildfire smoke could have either helped with the transmission of the virus or made people more susceptible to an infection,” he said. “When you have wildfire smoke, you have all these particles in the mix, and there is a high likelihood that a virus could attach to these particles and travel further [through the air] than it otherwise would have.”Henderson added that wildfire smoke “gums up the upper respiratory tract epithelium” — a thin layer of cells that’s covered in phlegm and mucus, the body’s first line of defense to keep viruses out of the body. Inhaling smoke also triggers an immune response in the lungs, which may weaken the immune system’s ability to fight the coronavirus, making it easier for an infection to take hold.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe authors of the new study noted that people with heart or lung disease, children and the elderly are particularly susceptible to the health impacts of wildfire smoke.But Henderson stressed that the risk goes far beyond those populations.“Everyone is potentially at risk when it’s smoky,” she said. “The risk is small for any individual, but because millions of individuals are exposed, those risks add up when you’re talking about whole populations.”She also warned that experts need to look at the findings from last year in the context of the new, more contagious variants circulating this year. The hypertransmissible delta variant, which accounts for more than 90 percent of new cases in the U.S., didn’t exist last year.In the short term, the best thing people can do to protect themselves is to get vaccinated against Covid-19. “There’s nothing that says wildfire smoke negates vaccination,” said Josey of Harvard.But looking to the future, to mitigate the dangers of wildfires, the solution is to address the issues contributing to climate change, he said.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

Ongoing heat waves and drought throughout the West have also exacerbated conditions, making fires longer, hotter and harder to contain.While rationing supplies is not necessarily unheard of during busy fire seasons, these directives came much earlier than anticipated.“I wouldn't say it’s extraordinary, but I would say it’s unusual for this time of year to see this high demand,” said Carrie Bilboa, a spokesperson for the National Interagency Fire Center. “This year started so soon and these large fires are continuing. They’re extending months long.”In Northern California, firefighters have spent nearly a month battling the ravenous Dixie Fire, which leveled a historic Gold Rush-era town and destroyed nearly 900 buildings. It has burned more than 500,000 acres and was 30 percent contained as of Wednesday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.At least 105 large fires are now raging across 14 states, scorching some 2.4 million acres. The Richard Spring Fire in Montana is showing “extreme fire behavior” and made a “significant run” of nearly 90,000 acres in the last 24 hours, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which warns of increased fire threats for Northern California, the Pacific Northwest, portions of the Great Basin and Northern Rockies “due to hot, dry, and windy conditions and the potential for lightning.”Across the Pacific Northwest, temperatures are forecast to soar 10-20 degrees above average, resulting in highs in the 90s to 100s for coastal as well as inland cities. This is the sixth heat wave for a region that just experienced its hottest June and July combined on record, and the relentless heat is fueling the wildfires.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

He denied setting any fires to investigators, court documents say.Prosecutors cited the smaller fires' proximity to the Dixie Fire in asking a judge to order that Maynard be detained.""The area in which Maynard chose to set his fires is near the ongoing Dixie fire, a fire which is still not contained despite the deployment and efforts of over 5,000 personnel,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael D. Anderson wrote in a filing.The Dixie Fire, which is burning in four counties in Northern California, is the largest wildfire in the U.S. and the second-largest fire in California history since accurate records began being kept.A judge ordered Maynard held. A federal defender listed as representing him did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.A possible motive was not clear from documents. The affidavit filed in the case cites a call to San Jose police from a concerned neighbor in October that raised mental health concerns. In another incident in July, a witness reported that he seemed unwell and had displayed a large knife, according to the document.U.S. Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman said in a court hearing Tuesday that there may be mental health issues and ordered Maynard to be detained, The Sacramento Bee reported.Maynard had previously told another investigator looking into a July fire that he was a professor, according to the affidavit.Santa Clara University and Sonoma State University said Tuesday that he had been with those institutions in the past but not recently.Santa Clara University said Maynard was an adjunct faculty member in the sociology department from September 2019 to December 2020. Sonoma State University said he was a part-time lecturer in the department of criminology and criminal justice last fall and was contracted to fill in for someone on leave.Maynard had been investigated after his vehicle was seen in a remote area near a July fire, the Cascade Fire, in Shasta-Trinity National Forest, according to court documents. Mountain bikers saw the fire, called 911 and helped put it out; around 200 square feet burned.Another fire, also believed to have been arson, was spotted and extinguished the next day, according to the affidavit. Eventually, a judge signed off on an order to place a tracking device on the vehicle, according to the document.As of Tuesday night, the Dixie Fire was at 490,205 acres, or almost 766 square miles, and it was 27 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. Of the structures destroyed, 547 were single residences, the agency said.A cause has not been determined and is under investigation.

It destroyed the homes of 15 relatives who live in town — including his sister's house, where he lived as a boy.""The emotions are gone,"" Hovland said as he looked out at the wreckage of his thrift store. ""I'm just trying to stay focused and do what I'm here to do: helping rebuild.""The Dixie Fire, revved up by dry vegetation and 40 mph wind gusts, ripped through this Sierra Nevada community last week, wiping out a gas station, a church, a hotel, a museum, neighborhood schools and dozens of homes.""We lost Greenville tonight,"" Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., who represents the area, said in a video posted on Facebook. ""There's just no words.""In the wake of the devastation, Hovland and other residents are trying to map a way forward — in some cases without permanent roofs over their heads or cherished possessions to their name.Hovland said his relatives are temporarily living in motel rooms or camping out in trailers in cow pastures. He is especially concerned about his sister and her family, saying ""she doesn't know what to do"" after having lost so much.""Everything's just overwhelmed,"" he said.The Dixie Fire, the largest wildfire burning in the U.S. and the second largest in California history, was about 25 percent contained at 8 a.m. local time Tuesday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.The fire has scorched 487,764 acres across four California counties.No deaths have been reported, officials in Plumas County have said. Three firefighters have been injured, and nearly 900 buildings have been destroyed, according to Cal Fire.Annika Peacock, who lives about 30 minutes away from Greenville in the town of Chester, evacuated last week amid fears that the Dixie Fire would quickly spread to her area.Peacock, a beekeeper, fears that her business is lost because the apiary is likely to be covered in flame retardant and thick smoke that could kill all her bees.""We are entirely sure that, by the day we are able to return, the bees will be long gone,"" she said.In the town of Philo, more than 300 miles southwest of Greenville, Brandy Johnson and her partner are giving temporary shelter to Johnson's parents, her brother, his wife and their three teenage children after the three-story home where they lived in Greenville burned to the ground.""It's just overwhelming. I'm really numb,"" Johnson said in a phone interview Tuesday.Johnson's family is camping in tents and sleeping in the beds of Chevy trucks near her one-room property while they try to figure out the next chapter of their lives. She said they are striving to stay in good spirits and trying not to think about lost possessions — ""just stuff,"" she said.She said her family is trying to rent a place near Greenville so that, after the fire clears up, they can return to town and begin rebuilding their lives.""They're focusing on next steps.

37,Dixie Fire becomes 2nd largest in California history; Pacific Northwest braces for more heat,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/dixie-fire-becomes-2nd-largest-california-history-west-braces-6th-n1276330,Mon Aug 09 2021 16:15:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"Devastating wildfires are sweeping across wide sections of the parched West.On Monday, there were 107 active large fires burning across 13 states. The Dixie Fire in northwestern California is now the largest fire in the country, outpacing the massive Bootleg Fire in Oregon by more than 75,000 acres.The Dixie Fire, which is only 21 percent contained, also is the largest single fire ever to tear through California, scorching nearly a half-million acres as of Monday. The largest fire ever in California was the 2020 August Complex Fire, which burned more than 1 million acres, but a ""complex fire"" is a coalescence of several blazes into one.According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, as of Sunday afternoon 876,055 acres had already burned across the state, a more than 200 percent increase compared with acres burned by this same time last year.Smoke was blanketing portions of the Rockies and Northern Plains on Monday and was predicted to waft into the Great Lakes region by Tuesday. Air quality has been reduced so drastically, meteorologists advised people to remain indoors as much as possible, and keep air purification devices on.The heat and lack of rain isn't just fueling the wildfire threat, but also threatening the water supply. The largest reservoirs in the country are falling to record low levels. Lake Mead, Lake Powell, Lake Oroville and Great Salt Lake have all reported record lows over the past few weeks — and are still dropping —threatening critical hydroelectric power output and water supplies.And with yet another heat wave looming this week, conditions aren't expected to improve much.About 11 million people were under excessive heat watches across the Pacific Northwest, stretching from just north of San Francisco to the Washington-Canada border. The heatwave is expected to peak mid- to late week, when temperatures could spike more than 20 degrees above average. Nearly three dozen high temperature records could be set.Portland is expected to hit back-to-back readings of 104 degrees on Thursday and Friday. Although not nearly as hot as the record high of 116 set earlier this summer, the hot weather is still an anomaly in the Pacific Northwest where the temperature is usually in the high 70s and low 80s this time of year. The extreme heat and low humidity through the week will enhance the drought that currently afflicts over 95 percent of the West, and may cause current wildfires to spread and spark new wildfires.Wildfires are erupting across the world, including across portions of Turkey, Greece and Italy. Greece is experiencing its most severe heatwave in 30 years.This comes as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change releases its first major comprehensive publication since 2013. Built upon the contributions of more than 230 international scientists, the report provides the strongest case yet that human emissions have already caused irreparable harm to the earth's atmosphere, ocean and land, jeopardizing its fragile ecosystems. The assessment predicts that in just 10 years, the global temperature will likely soar above the critical 2 degree C (3.6 degrees F) level set by the Copenhagen Summit and Paris Accords. Such a rise will result in more frequent and more severe wildfires and floods, likely plunging the planet into irreversible peril.Read the full report here.Jeremy Lewan is an intern with the NBC News Climate Unit.

38,What a recently burned tract of land in Oregon can teach us about fighting wildfires,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-wildfire-turns-preserve-living-lab-testing-years-forest-management-n1276269,Sun Aug 08 2021 08:42:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. — It was around 4 p.m. in mid-July when ecologist Pete Caligiuri saw 150-foot flames from the Bootleg Fire pour over a nearby ridge and creep closer to a facility where researchers have been studying wildfire behavior and mitigation techniques.""The flames were well above the biggest trees,"" said Caligiuri, the Oregon forest program director for the Nature Conservancy, which runs research at the Sycan Marsh Preserve in Fremont-Winema National Forest.The facility has served as home base for researchers who spent the last decade thinning young trees and using controlled burns to restore giant ponderosa pines to a more fire-resistant state.By combining modern wildfire science with traditional tribal knowledge of the Klamath people, the researchers seek to understand whether returning forests to their original condition, including allowing them to burn at low intensity every few years, can ultimately help make wildfires less devastating to the ecology and neighboring communities.The question is paramount as 107 large wildfires were consuming more than 2.1 million acres across 14 states as of Saturday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.On Friday, the Dixie Fire in Northern California exploded by 100,000 acres and overtook Oregon's Bootleg Fire as the largest blaze in the country. It tore through the historic town of Greenville earlier in the week. Video showed homes and vehicles engulfed in flames, commercial structures gutted and buildings collapsed in the mountain community of around 800 people, leaving the town in ashes and unrecognizable.The devastation has raised doubts among state and federal leaders about the safety and efficacy of the U.S. Forest Service's so-called let-it-burn strategy, referring to the practice of monitoring some small wildfires rather than suppressing them immediately. California Gov. Gavin Newsom was among several officials to publicly criticize the strategy during a virtual meeting last month with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Western governors, calling the practice an ""elephant in the room.""""You can't just walk away, not with this climate, not with this drought, "" Newsom said as he toured ruins left behind by the Tamarack Fire in Northern California, the Los Angeles Times reported. ""This is life and death, and we can't just fight fires the way we did 20, 30, 40 years ago anymore.""Less than a week later, U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore issued a memo to staff members reversing course and immediately halting the policy in favor of better prioritizing resources and preventing small wildfires from exploding into deadly complexes.""We are in a 'triage mode' where our primary focus must be on fires that threaten communities and infrastructure,"" Moore wrote. ""When western fire activity abates, we will resume using all the tools in our toolbox, including wildfire and prescribed fire in the right places and at the right time.""In Oregon, where the Bootleg Fire scorched more than 413,000 acres and destroyed nearly 200 homes, an initial assessment of land previously treated with controlled burns and tree thinning suggests that the efforts paid off and could hold valuable lessons for better forest management.The treated lands appeared to have better withstood wildfire, burning closer to the ground and leaving tree crowns green. In areas not previously treated, the Bootleg Fire incinerated 200- to 400-year-old pines from top to bottom, creating a moonscape of charred and ashy soil that will take years to heal.The early findings add to a growing body of research about how to make wildfires less explosive by thinning undergrowth and allowing forests to burn periodically instead of extinguishing every flame.""This never should have happened,"" said Craig Bienz, program director for the Sycan Marsh Preserve. ""The use of fire never should have been discontinued. We should have always continued to manage our forests to sustain them in the long term.""Fremont-Winema National Forest stretches across 2.3 million acres of wilderness in southern Oregon. It once belonged to the Klamath Tribes, comprising the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin-Paiute peoples, who signed a treaty in 1864 ceding much of their ancestral land to the federal government. The hope was to retain some of the land for hunting, gathering and water rights for future generations, but the Klamath Tribes lost control of their part in the 1950s.In 2011, the Forest Service and the Klamath Tribes entered into a partnership to treat forested lands using modern science and Indigenous practices. The Sycan preserve — ""Sycan"" translates to ""level grassy place"" in the Klamath language — is part of a larger historic site for the Klamath people, and it remains an important link between the new world and the one that existed before European settlers arrived.Over time, the forest has deteriorated because of an overreliance on fire suppression, which allowed small trees and undergrowth to spread and cause an imbalance in the ecosystem. The imbalance can contribute to higher-intensity wildfires that burn longer and hotter rather than make forests healthier, said Steve Rondeau, natural resources director of the Klamath Tribes.The research is leading back to the ""native way of doing things,"" Rondeau said.""The goal isn't necessarily to go back to how things used to be but to look back and take lessons from how things were different then and how they have changed over time,"" he said.Don Gentry, chairman of the Klamath Tribal Council, grew up fishing and hunting with his father in the surrounding forest. He still recalls hearing stories as a child about how his ancestors lived off the land and used wildfires to stimulate plants and even herd animals. Back then, hunters could count on killing at least one deer, but now wildlife is becoming increasingly scarce.The destruction left behind by the Bootleg Fire serves as a sorrowful reminder of everything the tribes have lost through the generations, Gentry said.""This is a time for grieving,"" he added. ""It's a devastating loss.""Sitting in his home in Klamath Falls, about an hour outside Fremont-Winema National Forest, Gentry smiles thinking about fishing and hunting those lands with his young grandson.A shadow crosses his face as he thinks about the devastation that will greet them the next time they go fishing. These days, Gentry grimly jokes with his grandson that soon he will be older than most of the trees left in the ancient forest.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

It climbed from more than 320,000 acres to 432,000 from Thursday evening to Friday morning.Seven of the largest wildfires in California history, including the Dixie Fire, occurred within the last three years.Scott Stephens, a professor of wildfire science at the University of California-Berkeley, said the explosion of wildfires in the past decade has been fueled by the culmination of drought conditions, hotter temperatures and flammable forest debris, like downed trees. These conditions, he said, are exacerbated by climate change.""The Dixie Wildfire has grown tremendously the last few days,"" Stephens said. ""They almost had it contained and worked on a containment line, but spots that were still on fire were actually thrown farther away from the burnout operation.""""The wildfire growth in the last 10 to 15 years has really exceeded what we would have considered previously, and we're seeing these fires grow larger and larger and more continuous,"" he said.On Wednesday, the Dixie Fire destroyed the historic California town of Greenville, leveling businesses and homes.Footage showed homes and vehicles engulfed in flames, commercial structures gutted and buildings collapsed in the mountain community of around 800 — leaving the town in ashes and completely unrecognizable.Among the buildings lost were a former sheriff's office, stores, restaurants, saloons and gas stations.The record blaze comes on the heels of other large wildfires ravaging countries across the world, including Greece and Turkey. Thousands of people have evacuated their homes in both countries.A wildfire just north of Athens left one person dead. And in Turkey, wildfires have ravaged swaths of its southern coast, killing eight people in the past 10 days.Stephens said there was still hope to prevent wildfires from exploding in size.""We have to do much more forest restoration work, like burning small, controlled fires,"" he said.

It had been 56 percent contained on Saturday.“That reflects several good days of work on the ground where crews have been able to reinforce and build additional containment lines,” fire spokesman Al Nash said Sunday.The blaze has scorched over 646 square miles since it was sparked by lightning July 6 in Fremont-Winema National Forest.California's Dixie Fire covered nearly 383 square miles in mountains where 42 homes and other buildings have been destroyed.It was 32 percent contained Sunday, and evacuation orders and warnings were lifted for several areas of Butte and Plumas counties. The cause of the blaze, which ignited July 13, was still under investigation.Authorities warned that with unpredictable winds and extremely dry fuels, the risk of flare-ups remained high.In recent days, lightning sparked two wildfires that threatened remote homes in Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Evacuation warnings remained in place Sunday for communities along the Trinity River.In Montana, a wind-driven wildfire destroyed more than a dozen homes, outbuildings and other structures, authorities said Sunday. Evacuations were ordered after flames jumped a highway and moved toward communities near Flathead Lake in the northwestern part of the state.Crews also battled major blazes in northeast Washington and northern Idaho.Nearly 22,000 firefighters and support personnel were battling 91 large, active wildfires covering 2,813 square miles in mostly Western states, the National Interagency Fire Center said.A historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the West. Scientists say that climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and that it will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.The U.S. Drought Monitor reported last week that while a robust monsoon has delivered drought-easing rainfall to the Southwest, critically dry conditions persist across Northern California and the Northwest, where there has been an expansion of “exceptional drought,” the worst category.Dry conditions and powerful winds made for dangerous fire conditions in Hawaii. A wind advisory was issued Sunday for parts of Lanai, Maui and the Big Island."

The air quality in the area has deteriorated to very unhealthy levels.California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for four northern counties as flames spread Friday, saying the wildfires were causing ""conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property.""Many fires are burning across the U.S. West, where extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made them difficult to fight.Nearly 90 large fires had scorched more than 1.4 million acres across 13 states as of Saturday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.Oregon's Bootleg Fire — the country's largest inferno — was nearly halfway surrounded Saturday as more than 2,200 firefighters made progress corralling it, officials said.There has been so much smoke from the fires in the West that it is helping firefighters gain ground on the Bootleg Fire by blocking sunlight, officials said Saturday.""It's called 'smoke shading,' and it's basically put a lid on the lower atmosphere for now, blocking sunlight and creating cooler, more stable surface conditions,"" said Eric Schoening, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Salt Lake City. The phenomenon, however, is unpredictable, and the area was still under red-flag warnings over the weekend.While the growth of the fire finally slowed, thousands of homes in southern Oregon remained threatened. Extreme fire behavior and an unstable atmosphere created by the Bootleg Fire formed a tornado in the area last weekend.""With the critically dry weather and fuels we are experiencing, firefighters are having to constantly reevaluate their control lines and look for contingency options,"" Jim Hanson, a fire behavior analyst, said Saturday in a news release from the Oregon Forestry Department.Also Saturday, fire crews from California and Utah headed to Montana, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced, after five firefighters remained hospitalized after a thunderstorm blew a lightning-caused Montana wildfire back onto them. The extent of their injuries was still unknown.Another high-priority wildfire, the Alder Creek Fire in southwest Montana, had charred over 6,800 acres and threatened hundreds of homes. It was only 10 percent contained Saturday night.Firefighters also battled blazes Saturday in north-central Washington, where hundreds of homes are under threat and air quality conditions continue to deteriorate.While a chance of scattered thunderstorms over the weekend could offer some respite across California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona and other Western states, forecasters warned that dry storms that produce little rain but a lot of lightning can spark new blazes.The smoke from the fierce fires has been carried all the way across the continental U.S. to the East Coast, where air quality alerts were issued."
48,Firefighting could reach new heights with space-based tech to prevent wildfires,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/using-satellites-ai-space-based-technology-shaping-future-firefighting-n1274807,Sat Jul 24 2021 08:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"The current space race isn’t just for billionaires.Using satellites, drones and artificial intelligence, emerging technology is changing the way firefighting agencies and governments battle the ever-increasing threat of wildfires as hundreds of thousands of acres burn across the western United States.New programs are being developed by startups and research institutions to predict fire behavior, monitor drought and even detect fires when they first start. As climate change continues to increase the intensity and frequency of wildfires, these breakthroughs offer at least one tool in the growing arsenal of prevention and suppression strategies.“This is not to replace firefighting on the ground,” said Ilkay Altintas, a computer scientist with the University of California, San Diego, who developed a fire map for the region. “The more science and data we can give firefighters and the public, the quicker we’ll have solutions to combat and mitigate wildfires.”More than 80 large fires and complexes have scorched more than 1.3 million acres across 13 states this year as of Friday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and additional fires are breaking out almost every week.The country’s largest inferno, the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon, has forced thousands of residents to evacuate since lightning sparked it July 6. Smoke from the Western blazes is so thick that East Coast residents were treated this week to a spectacular, if worrisome, fiery sunrise and hazy skies.“As the risk for catastrophic wildfire grows, so should our ability to forecast wildfires and to mitigate fire risk,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said last month during a House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology hearing.Her own district near Silicon Valley was one of several Northern California communities affected by last year’s CZU Lightning Complex Fire that torched nearly 90,000 acres over five weeks. Lofgren is working to introduce legislation that would bolster funding for the “understanding, prediction, and management of wildland fires through robust research initiatives.” Her bill would also aim to better integrate science agencies into federal wildfire response strategies, she said.Despite Silicon Valley's proximity to some of California's biggest fires, the tech capital has been slow to embrace firefighting innovation. That started to change over the last year as more startups entered the sector, looking for federal and state partners to fund projects.The U.S. Forest Service already uses predictive tools to monitor fire weather, fire danger and fuels, and provide intelligence for incident commanders, firefighters and support staff. But many of the tools available rely on satellite imaging that can take hours to transmit and analyze.""A lot of the current operations just aren’t getting situational awareness as frequently as they would like,"" said Andre Coleman, who is leading a team of researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington.With initial funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Coleman helped develop a system in 2014 called Rapid Analytics for Disaster Response, or RADR, that uses image-capturing technology from satellites, aircraft, drones, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to assess the impact of natural disasters, including wildfires. An expanded version of the tool, called RADR-Fire, can reveal wildfire boundaries multiple times a day and link impact and risk to structures, substations and other critical infrastructure in the landscape.Typically, when incident commanders can't get an accurate read of a how big a fire is or where exactly it's burning, they order aircraft support to record images of the fire, Coleman explained. Those images are then analyzed by support staff who create a map of the fire lines. The process can take hours where Coleman's tool can provide the information within minutes.""Coordination can be challenging,"" he said. ""This can help with evacuation routes to help understand where search and rescue needs to go.""German company OroraTech is also aiming to provide real-time fire data but at a global scale. Based in Munich, the startup is building a constellation of 100 small satellites, about the size of a shoebox each, outfitted with thermal infrared cameras to monitor the planet and report, within an hour of ignition, any fire larger than 10 meters, or about 33 feet.The first of these nanosatellites will launch in December with the help of the Silicon Valley-based Spire, a space-to-cloud data and analytics company, and Space X. Fourteen more satellites could launch by 2023.“Having an overview from the top, with the highest possible refresh rate, that is the most important part” of understanding and predicting fire behavior, Björn Stoffers, OroraTech co-founder and chief marketing officer, said.“We saw that every state has their own system and their own warning tools, and we saw huge discrepancies with those maps, especially with them being outdated,” he said. “We’re already quite a bit faster.”Last year, while smoke from the historic wildfires choked the air for millions of people across the country, OroraTech graduated from the Google Accelerator. Since then, the company raised $7 million in investments to build its global wildfire warning system. Its software platform is already being used in Canada, South America, Africa and Australia but the big target is signing partners in the United States, Stoffers said.A quick tutorial of the program revealed a map similar to Google Earth that shows not just the location of a fire, but also any surrounding spot fires, air particles, wind patterns and cloud cover. Researchers are currently working to add a lightning strike layer to the existing platform. Users can also measure the distance of smoke plumes and see, in real time, the direction dangerous air particles are traveling.OroraTech is just one of several companies using space-based technology to monitor wildfires. San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company Chooch AI uses a system that analyzes satellite images every 10 minutes to identify where new wildfires started, The Associated Press reported. And tech startup Salo Sciences teamed up with Planet, a satellite company founded by NASA scientists, to build a monitoring system called the California Forest Observatory, which uses AI and satellite images to create a detailed map of forested land in California to help predict and prevent wildfires.“Especially in California, if Silicon Valley is next to those wildfire disasters, you can bet there are other companies working to mitigate the effects,” Stoffers said.In Southern California, Ilkay Altintas and her team of computer scientists at the University of California, San Diego’s WIFIRE Lab developed a fire map for the region that can be used by incident commanders and researchers to model fire behavior in real time.The map uses artificial intelligence and information from previous fires to predict how new fires will burn and to help plan prescribed burns, which can help keep forests thinned and healthy and therefore prevent future megafires like what the West has experienced over the last few years.“In California, we do science and tech really well,” Altintas said. “It’s an evolution of what we already have.”WIFIRE Lab’s fire map is already being used, she added, by local and state agencies in Southern California, and helped inform attack plans for the Palisades Fire, which threatened homes in affluent Los Angeles-area neighborhoods, and the Bobcat Fire last year that came close to the historic Mount Wilson Observatory in the Angeles National Forest.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

Firefighter Charlie Morton, a hotshot squad boss, died battling the blaze Sept. 17.""He’s fighting a fire that was started because of a smoke bomb. That's the only reason he's there,"" San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson said at a news conference.Refugio and Angela Jimenez were arraigned Tuesday, and both pleaded not guilty, Anderson said. They were released on their own recognizance.Online court records did not appear to show their cases Tuesday night, and it was not clear if they had an attorney. A phone number for them could not immediately be found.The case was presented to a criminal grand jury, which returned a true bill Monday and led to the indictments, Anderson said.The pair is charged with involuntary manslaughter, three counts of recklessly causing a fire with great bodily injury, four counts of recklessly causing a fire to inhabited structures, and 22 misdemeanor counts that deal with fire to other property, Anderson said.Morton, 39, was a Big Bear Interagency Hotshot squad boss. Hotshot crews can be sent all over the United States to fight wildland fires.The El Dorado Fire led to evacuations and destroyed five homes. When it erupted temperatures in the area were 15 to 20 degrees higher than normal, fire officials have said.It was part of what California officials called one of the worst fire seasons in the nation's history. Experts have said that climate change is exacerbating wildfire conditions and contributing to longer and more intense fire seasons.The Western U.S. is experiencing extreme heat and wildfires, including the massive Bootleg Fire in Oregon.The Bootleg Fire, the largest wildfire in the U.S., has grown to more than 388,000 acres — or more than 606 square miles — and has seen extreme behavior that has forced crews to move to safety zones, officials said.

On Tuesday, 3 million people remained under red flag warnings blanketing eight states across the Northwest and the northern Plains, including the area of the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, currently the largest fire this year.Now classified as a megafire,or a fire burning more than 100,000 acres, the Bootleg Fire has blazed over 350,000 acres, which is about half the size of Rhode Island, and was only 30 percent contained as of Tuesday.Conditions surrounding the area have exhibited extreme fire behavior, and the massive inferno has been so powerful that it created its own weather, generating dangerous columns of lightning-charged smoke and ash, called pyrocumulus or pyrocumulonimbus clouds, reaching the stratosphere. These can reach more than 40,000 feet into the atmosphere - the altitude at which commercial airplanes fly.The Beckwourth Complex Fire, raging in Northern California, has topped 100,000 acres burned, also earning the megafire title. With more than 1,000 firefighters working, the fire was nearly 90 percent contained Tuesday.Pacific Gas and Electric, California's largest utility, may be responsible for another blaze licking across Northern California. On Sunday, a spokesperson admitted that blown fuses on one of its utility poles may have sparked the Dixie Fire, which is 30,000 acres and growing. This comes after PG&E has taken responsibility for the devastating 2018 Camp Fire and the 2019 Kincade Fire that burned more than 100 square miles of Sonoma County.According to an update Monday from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, compared to this same time last year, there are over 900 more fires and 165,000 additional acres burned. For context, 2020 was the worst Western fire season in history.The situation has become so dire that the National Interagency Fire Center has upgraded the national preparedness level to the highest category, Level 5, signifying that at least 80 percent of wildland firefighters are currently responding to fires.Wildfire growth and spread are expected to intensify through the week as yet another major heat wave roasted the high Plains and the Rocky Mountains, peaking Monday. Triple-digit temperatures, combined with humidity as low as 10 percent and wind gusts up to 40 mph, will produce ideal wildfire conditions. An additional major concern is the dry thunderstorms expected to flare along the interior Northwest, producing abundant lightning that could easily spark sun-baked vegetation.Climate scientists are certain that temperatures this extreme would have been ""virtually impossible without climate change.""Jeremy Lewan is an intern with the NBC News Climate Unit.

The blaze just north of the California border was 25% contained.Meteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather through at least Monday with lightning possible in both California and southern Oregon.“With the very dry fuels, any thunderstorm has the potential to ignite new fire starts,” the National Weather Service in Sacramento, California, said on Twitter.Thousands of people were already facing evacuation orders, including some 2,000 people residing in the largely rural areas of lakes and wildlife refuges near the fire, which has burned at least 67 homes and 100 outbuildings while threatening many more.Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have swept the region, making wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.Firefighters said in July they were facing conditions more typical of late summer or fall.Pyrocumulus clouds — literally translated as “fire clouds” — complicated containment efforts for the Dixie Fire in northern California on Sunday, as well as flames that spread to remote areas with steep terrain that are harder for crews to reach, officials said. New evacuation orders were issued in rural communities near the Feather River Canyon.The Dixie Fire remained 15% contained and covered 29 square miles. The fire is northeast of the town of Paradise, California, and survivors of that horrific fire that killed 85 people watched warily as the blaze burned.A growing wildfire south of Lake Tahoe jumped a highway, prompting more evacuation orders, the closure of the Pacific Crest Trail and the cancellation of an extreme bike ride through the Sierra Nevada.The Tamarack Fire, which was sparked by lightning on July 4, had charred about 28.5 square miles of dry brush and timber as of Sunday night. The blaze was threatening Markleeville, a small town close to the California-Nevada state line. It has destroyed at least two structures, authorities said.A notice posted Saturday on the 103-mile Death Ride’s website said several communities in the area had been evacuated and ordered all bike riders to clear the area. The fire left thousands of bikers and spectators stranded in the small town and racing to get out.Kelli Pennington and her family were camping near the town Friday so her husband could participate in his ninth ride when they were told to leave. They had been watching smoke develop over the course of the day, but were caught off guard by the fire’s quick spread.“It happened so fast,” Pennington said. “We left our tents, hammock and some foods, but we got most of our things, shoved our two kids in the car and left.”About 800 fire personnel were assigned to battle the flames by Sunday night, “focusing on preserving life and property with point protection of structures and putting in containment lines where possible,” the U.S. Forest Service said.A fire in the mountains of northeast Oregon grew to more than 18 square miles (48 square kilometers) by Sunday. The Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, remote communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. It was 10% contained.Natural features of the area act like a funnel for wind, feeding the flames and making them unpredictable, officials said.There were about 70 active large fires and complexes of multiple blazes that have burned nearly 1,659 square miles in the U.S., the National Interagency Fire Center said. The U.S. Forest Service said at least 16 major fires were burning in the Pacific Northwest alone."

It has destroyed at least three structures, authorities said. A notice posted on the 103-mile Death Ride’s website said several communities in the area had been evacuated and ordered all riders to also evacuate immediately.Kelli Pennington and her family were camping near the town Friday so her husband could participate in his ninth ride when they were told to pack up and leave. They had been watching smoke develop over the course of the day, but were caught off guard by the fire’s quick spread.“It happened so fast,” Pennington said. “We left our tents, hammock and some foods, but we got most of our things, shoved our two kids in the car and left.”Saturday’s ride was supposed to mark the 40th anniversary of the Death Ride, which attracts thousands of cyclists each year to ride through three mountain passes in the so-called California Alps.Afternoon winds blowing at 20 to 30 mph fanned the flames as they chewed through bone-dry timber and brush.Meanwhile, the largest wildfire in the U.S. — burning in southern Oregon — grew significantly overnight as dry and windy conditions took hold in the area, but containment of the inferno more than tripled as firefighters began to gain more control along its western flank, authorities said Saturday. The fire was still burning rapidly and dangerously along its southern and eastern flanks, however, and authorities expanded evacuations in a largely rural area of lakes and wildlife refuges.A red flag weather warning, signifying strong winds and hot, dry conditions, remained in effect through Saturday evening.“This fire is large and moving so fast, every day it progresses 4 to 5 miles,” said Incident Commander Joe Hassel. “One of the many challenges that our firefighters face every day is working in new country that can present new hazards all the time.”Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have swept the region, making wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.In southern Oregon, fire crews have dealt with dangerous and extreme fire conditions, including massive “fire clouds” that rise up to 6 miles above the blaze. The Bootleg Fire has destroyed at least 67 homes and 117 outbuildings.It has forced 2,000 people to evacuate and is threatening 5,000 buildings, including homes and smaller structures in a rural area just north of the California border. Containment of the fire more than tripled Saturday thanks to better conditions on the western edge of the fire that allowed crews to drop water and fire retardant on flames and secure fire breaks.The National Weather Service warned of possible thunderstorms stretching from the California coast to northern Montana on Sunday and that “new lightning ignitions” are likely because of extremely dry fuels across the West.Firefighters said in July they were facing conditions more typical of late summer or fall.The Bootleg Fire grew to 439 square miles Saturday and was just one of numerous fires burning across the drought-stricken U.S. West, as new fires popped up or grew rapidly in Oregon and California.There were 70 active large fires and complexes of multiple fires that have burned nearly 1,659 square miles in the U.S., the National Interagency Fire Center said. The U.S. Forest Service said at least 16 major fires were burning in the Pacific Northwest alone."
54,Map: Heat and drought drive Western wildfires,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/west-tinderbox-heat-drought-set-stage-huge-wildfires-burning-across-n1274195,Fri Jul 16 2021 17:50:24 GMT+0000 (UTC),"Much of the western United States is one unlucky lightning strike or misplaced ember away from a major wildfire, thanks to a rare and dangerous combination of climate conditions.The huge wildfires currently burning across California and Oregon are the result of a mix of a historic drought, extreme heat and several other conditions that have the area primed to burn, scientists and fire experts say. And with more heat and dry weather expected in the coming months, this fire season could be worse than any in recent times.An NBC News analysis of 30 years of fire risk data shows that the heat dome that baked much of the region in late June was the final ingredient needed for explosive fire risk. This heat, on the heels of an extremely dry winter and spring, and in some places a few such such years, took the region from dry to even drier, allowing even the smallest spark to ignite a conflagration. This has led to a higher than average number of fires in the region so far this year.The Energy Release Component, an index compiled by a collection of government agencies called the National Wildlife Coordinating Group that takes into account plant moisture conditions and is used by fire scientists to gauge fire risk, spiked significantly above average in several states prone to forest fires, including California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington, following the record-breaking temperatures in late June. Experts say this shows that the conditions were ripe for the early, strong start to the wildfire season.“I like to think about the ingredients of fire being somewhat similar to the ingredients you need to start a campfire,” said John Abatzoglou, an associate professor at the University of California Merced’s Climatology Lab. “You need enough fuel, some fine fuels [kindling, flammable plant matter], you need that fuel to be dry enough, and you need an ignition source to bring all those three things together and you have what it takes for a fire.”In 2021 all of the ingredients have come together, leaving the region ready for a fire.“The West is a tinderbox this year,” Abatzoglou said.The high heat and dry weather have led to conditions on the ground throughout the Northwest that are normally seen much later in a typical fire season.“We're seeing fire behavior that we typically don't see until the middle of August,” said Josh Harvey, the fire management bureau chief at the Idaho Department of Lands.Trees wet enough to resist the heat of an ignition usually help slow the spread of fires, experts say. Firefighters in Oregon say the conditions on the ground are so dry that even large trees are contributing to the spread.“It’s almost as if the trees are going up like grass,” said Jim Gersbach, a spokesperson at the Oregon Department of Forestry. “They’re going up that quickly and instantly torching, because the needles don’t have much moisture.”What starts a fire can be random, Abatzoglou said, pointing to lightning storms or accidental sparks from gender-reveal parties. But the conditions must be right for the fire to see explosive growth.“What we’re seeing, at least during years like this, is it’s dry for a long period of the year and over a large geographic area,” Abatzoglou said. “It’s those extra spins on that roulette wheel that increase the potential for fires to find their way to burn on the landscape.”Forests are also much denser due to the practice of putting out all wildfires for much of the last century, regardless of their threat to people. A dense forest requires more water to stay healthy, leaving it more likely to dry out and kindle an explosive fire.“Because of the way we’ve managed the forests, we’ve set up the conditions for fires to be more severe,” said Donald Falk, a professor at the University of Arizona School of Natural Resources and the Environment. “That’s on us. We’ve prevented fire from doing its job.”Even before the Beckwourth Complex Fire in California and the Bootleg Fire in Oregon exploded in size, firefighters this year have dealt with an abnormally high number of smaller fires.In Oregon, Gersbach said that firefighters have battled 68 percent more fires so far this year than average. And it’s not just Oregon: much of the western and northwestern U.S. has also been home to a significantly higher number of fire starts.With many states in the Northwest seeing similarly unprecedented and severe conditions, resources are running thin.“When we talk about resources available to fight these fires, the system is tapped,” said Harvey, from the Idaho Department of Lands. “There’s just not much out there.”Overstretched staffs make it more likely for small fires that would have been otherwise contained to grow out of control, Harvey said.Strong, consistent rains are what ends fire seasons, experts say. With the highest temperatures of a typical calendar year most likely yet to arrive, wildfires will get worse unless rainfall arrives.“We just don’t have a great reason to believe that’s going to happen,” Abatzoglou said.If strong winds arrive before the rains, an already bad fire season could become disastrous. Abatzoglou said that when wind hits a fire, especially in a drought, “you can get upwards of a half million acres in a couple days.”Experts say changes in the region’s climate mean that conditions will be increasingly ripe for fires.“What we do appreciate is that Oregon and much of the western United States is experiencing the cumulative effects of multiple years of drought, and that’s having an impact on fire frequency and intensity,” Gersbach said. “This is something of a new normal.”Nigel Chiwaya is a senior data editor for NBC News."

Butte County officials issued an evacuation warning for the small communities of Pulga and East Concow, east of Paradise.""A few of my neighbors said they are starting to get their stuff together,"" Larry Petersen, whose home survived the Camp Fire, told the NBC affiliate KNVN in Chico. ""Everybody is all a little worried about it. Just no one wants to go through that again.""""We get a little bit of that PTSD,"" Paradise resident Jennifer Younie added, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder. ""It's just about being prepared.""Elsewhere in the West, the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon, the largest wildfire burning in the United States, has torched an area bigger than New York City and destroyed at least 20 homes, fire officials said. It remained about 7 percent contained as of Friday morning.Also on Thursday, Gov. Gavin Newsom sent California firefighters to Oregon at the request of Gov. Kate Brown, including crews from San Francisco, Anaheim and Alameda County, building on an order issued last week.Lightning sparked the Bootleg Fire on July 6, and flames have been encroaching on the traditional territory of the Klamath Tribes, whose lands are in Klamath County near the California border. Huge, churning plumes of smoke have been visible for miles.Tim and Dee McCarley could see trees exploding into flames in their rearview mirror as they fled the fire last week at the last minute. They had put off their departure to pack more belongings and search for their missing cat.""The sheriff's department had been there and they said, 'If you don't get out of here now, then you are going to die,'"" Tim McCarley, 67, told The Associated Press as he, his wife and stepson rested Wednesday at a shelter at the Klamath County Fairgrounds.In total, more than 70 active wildfires across a dozen states have incinerated a combined area larger than Rhode Island, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which tracks the coordinated firefighting effort. The center said more than 2.25 million acres have been burned since the beginning of the year, compared to 1.7 million acres in the same period in 2020.The center on Wednesday declared the U.S. is at the highest alert level on its scale based on allocated firefighting resources. More than 17,000 firefighters and support personnel have been assigned to fight the wildfires, center spokesman Stanton Florea said Thursday.Last year, the center had not declared a ""preparedness level 5"" until Aug. 18, signifying how taxing this season has already been on resources.""We're a full month ahead of where we were last year — and last year was a historic season,"" Florea said.At least three states — Oregon, Washington and Montana — have declared emergencies.Florea blamed record temperatures across the West and a brutal drought, which has led Newsom to ask California residents last week to voluntarily cut back on their water consumption by 15 percent, for exacerbating extreme weather conditions fueled by climate change.Fire seasons ""are lasting longer. Fires are more intense ... we're seeing a sustained level of fire activity year-round, but certainly, this is the height of it for us this year,"" Florea said, adding that the country has ""reached that threshold where most of the firefighting resources are committed.""Fire danger warnings remained in effect Friday for Wyoming, Idaho and parts of Northern California.A combination of low humidity, wind gusts and the dry conditions from the drought are heightening the critical fire risk, with the greatest opportunity for new wildfires to spark or for existing ones to spread Thursday afternoon and evening, when winds are forecast to be the strongest.One silver lining, Florea said, is that the monsoon season has begun in the Southwestern U.S., tamping down the potential for increased fire activity in states such as Arizona and New Mexico.An extreme heat wave late last month sucked vegetation dry in the Pacific Northwest, where firefighters say they are facing conditions more typical of late summer or fall than early July.A fire in Chelan County in central Washington was threatening 1,500 homes along with orchards and a power station, authorities said. Mandatory evacuations were in effect.On Wednesday evening, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that its detectives helped the Chelan County Fire Marshal and federal fire investigators execute a search warrant at a nearby residence believed to be the origin of the fire.In north-central Washington, about 200 people in the town of Nespelem on Colville tribal land were evacuated Monday night as the largest of five wildfires caused by dozens of lightning strikes tore through grass, sagebrush and timber. Seven homes burned, but four of them were vacant.""The need for action to protect our climate, and to mitigate the effects of climate change, becomes clearer with each passing year and each round of devastating fires,"" Colville Tribal Chairman Andrew ""Badger"" Joseph Jr. said.Erik Ortiz is a staff writer for NBC News focusing on racial injustice and social inequality."

Of the 12 states, Idaho, Arizona, Montana and California accounted for a large majority of the wildfires.Wildfires blazed from as north as Alaska to as far midwest as Minnesota, the center said. Among the other states reporting active fires were Wyoming, Washington, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah.The Beckwourth Complex, the largest wildfire burning in California, has burned more than 91,200 acres. It was 26 percent contained by Monday evening, up from 8 percent Sunday, fire officials said.The fire complex was sparked by lightning in Plumas National Forest in Northern California, near the Nevada border, officials said. Around 20 homes were destroyed in the small town of Doyle, the fire department has said.There were extreme fire conditions, California Incident Management Operations Section Chief Jake Cagle said. The ""probability of ignition"" is 100 percent, which means any ember or match in a fuel bed will cause a fire, he said.""That's the kind of extreme weather conditions we're dealing with,"" Cagle said in a video briefing Monday. ""And it's still early. This is stuff that we expect in August, for the past five, six, seven years — now we're seeing it earlier in July.""In southern Oregon, the Bootleg Fire had grown by around 5,000 acres by Monday morning, an improvement over the doubling in size that the fire had seen in recent days.As of Tuesday morning, the fire was estimated at more than 200,000 acres, or about 312.5 square miles. It is burning in Fremont-Winema National Forest and started last Tuesday afternoon. A cause has not been determined.Fire officials said a smoke inversion allowed firefighters to build and strengthen fire control lines Sunday. The fire has destroyed seven homes, a spokesman for the Oregon fire marshal said.And in Arizona, two firefighters were killed in a plane crash while conducting aerial reconnaissance over the Cedar Basin Fire near Prescott National Forest, the Bureau of Land Management said in a statement.Much of the Western U.S. has been dealing with extreme heat that has set or matched temperature records.The heat wave has peaked for most areas, but excessive heat warnings will remain in place through Tuesday evening, the National Weather Service said.California is coming off what fire officials said was one of the state's worst years for wildfires. It included four of the five largest wildfires in California history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The state's fifth-most destructive wildfire, the North Complex, which killed 15 people and destroyed more than 2,300 homes and other structures, also occurred last year.Oregon also had a wildfire season that the governor said was unlike any other in recent memory. More than 1 million acres burned, more than 5,000 homes and commercial structures were destroyed, and nine people died, a government report released in January said.Phil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News."
57,White House to raise federal firefighter pay to $15 an hour,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-raise-federal-firefighter-pay-15-hour-n1272679,Wed Jun 30 2021 15:53:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is raising wages for federal firefighters to no less than $15 an hour, as the White House seeks to put a spotlight on the growing threats of wildfires and heat waves exacerbated by climate change.At the start of wildfire season, Biden met on Wednesday with governors, Cabinet members and business leaders to discuss how the United States can better prepare for what climate scientists say is a phenomenon that will only get worse as climate change fuels more frequent extreme weather events. The meeting comes a week after Biden, during a meeting with the FEMA chief, voiced surprise and outrage over federal firefighters making just $13 per hour.To that end, Biden said on Wednesday his administration will provide “bonuses” to firefighters to bump up their pay this year to $15 per hour, while working with Congress to try to increase the wages permanently. A senior administration official said the goal was ensure that firefighters are “fairly paid for the grueling and risky work that they're willing to take on.” The official did not specify where the money would come from or how the government would dole it out.“These courageous women and men take an incredible risk of running toward the fire, and they deserve to be paid and paid good wages,"" Biden said Wednesday. ""You know that old expression, God made man that he made a few firefighters. Well, it's true.""The move comes as wildfires are raging across California, Oregon, Arizona and Colorado, fueled in part by a record-shattering heat June heat wave that has sent temperatures surging well above 110 degrees in some places, subjected millions of Americans to red flag warnings and thrust the challenges of extreme weather and climate change into the forefront.Biden said drought conditions are expected to be worse than last year's devastating fire season and that there are currently 36 uncontained fires burning already with about 9,000 firefighters deployed across the Western U.S.""Climate change is driving the dangerous confluence of extreme heat and prolonged drought,"" Biden said. ""We're seeing wildfires of greater intensity that move with more speed and last well beyond traditional months and fire season. And that's a problem for all of us.""Biden’s meeting with governors and Cabinet members — some in person, some attending virtually — was to include a range of leaders from states particularly affected by wildfires and extreme heat, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last week.The boost in pay to $15 an hour is the most significant and immediate of an array of steps the White House announced aimed at improving recruitment and retention of firefighters while creating new avenues for the public to prepare and respond to wildfires.The White House also plans to hire more firefighters and transition more existing firefighters from seasonal to permanent roles, a move the official said reflected the reality that wildland fires are increasingly occurring year-round, rather than only during the summer. Permanent firefighters will be eligible for retention bonuses of up to 10 percent, the senior official said.The Biden administration also plans to improve early detection efforts through satellite monitoring and create more surge capacity for responding to fires through more equipment and aviation. And the federal government will invite more states in the Western United States to apply for “resilience grants” to fund projects for emergency preparedness and response, the official said.Biden announced a $37 million federal grant to Sonoma County in California to support fire mitigation efforts there.California' Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, described the relationship between his state and the White House under the Trump administration as ""sparing partners"" where the former president repeatedly blamed the fires on the state having not cleaned up enough dead brush.""We have an opportunity here to turn the page on the finger pointing rhetoric,"" he said.Josh Lederman is an NBC News correspondent.Shannon Pettypiece is the senior White House reporter for NBCNews.com."

They have the higher incidence of severe injuries than police officers do. They are incredibly, incredibly brave [in] what they do. They run to the fire,” Biden said during a Tuesday meeting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator and senior advisors from the Department of Homeland Security.“I didn’t realize this, I have to admit, that federal firefighters get paid $13 an hour,” he added. “That’s going to end in my administration. That’s a ridiculously low salary to pay federal firefighters.”Biden also announced that he would meet with Western governors and cabinet members next week to prepare for ""heat, drought and wildfires.""""We’re in for a tough season, but I think we’ve got to be prepared and have every resource available to make sure we’re there for the American people,"" Biden said.On the same day the president delivered his remarks, California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla, both Democrats, sent a joint letter with Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Steve Daines, R-Mont., calling on the financial services and general government subcommittee to include language in its 2022 funding bill directing the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the salaries of government employees, to raise federal firefighter pay.“Federal wildland firefighters’ salaries are significantly less than their counterparts at state and local wildland fire agencies, even though they have comparable job duties,” the senators wrote in the letter.“We believe strongly that the U.S. Government must modernize and update federal wildland firefighters’ job classifications and pay grading, which were established more than 30 years ago and are now woefully out of sync with the current wildfire risk and job market,” they added.Federal wildland firefighters are in a precarious situation where they are classified as forestry technicians who do not receive the same pay and benefits given to state and municipal firefighters. Many of them are hired as seasonal employees who must reapply for their jobs every year. The classification issue has long rankled employees of the the United States Forest Service, some of who grimly joke that only in death are they recognized as firefighters.USFS firefighter pay is dictated by the federal pay scale, where most start at the GS-3 level and pay tops out at around $31,000 annually for full-time employees. By comparison, a first-year firefighter with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, makes nearly double that amount.Because of the low pay and unreliable job security, states in the West are faced with a dwindling federal workforce as firefighters leave for Cal Fire or other more lucrative opportunities. The problem is especially acute in California, which is also seeing an uptick in fire activity year over year.""As fires increase in both size and complexity, we need a paradigm shift in the ways we fight these fires,"" Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an association that advocates on behalf of federal firefighters, said in a statement. ""Risking their lives and their mental health for wages starting below $14/hour has led to the unsustainable situation we are in now, unable to retain employees when we need them more than ever.""Our group represents the boots on the ground.We have been there, we have done that in the world of wildfire - And we especially don’t come to discuss problems without providing solutions.Thank you @potus for recognizing the pay disparity with our nation’s wildland firefighters.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."
59,Wildfires break out across Western states amid hottest week in history,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/wildfires-erupt-after-hottest-week-history-across-parts-west-ignited-n1271603,Mon Jun 21 2021 15:27:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"Last week featured one of the worst June heat waves in decades across the West, shattering hundreds of daily records, as well as several all-time hottest temperatures recorded for the month.Death Valley soared to a blistering 128 degrees, and Denver saw a rare hat trick of three 100-degree days in a row.Tucson saw eight straight days of temperatures 110 degrees or higher, breaking the record for the number of consecutive days above that barrier and making it the city's hottest week. Phoenix endured a record-setting six straight days of temperatures 115 or higher.All of this heat contributed to a high fire danger which came to fruition over the weekend when multiple blazes broke out in several Western states including California, Colorado, Arizona and Oregon.The Willow Fire in Monterey County, which forced evacuations Friday, continued to burn over the weekend sending smoke billowing into the Bay Area.The Cow Fire in Shasta County also prompted evacuation orders, and at one point Sunday required a large air tanker to be diverted off the Willow Fire for increased firefighting efforts.On Monday, 7 million people were under red flag warnings across six Western states where the combination of hot temperatures, wind gusts to 40 mph and bone-dry humidity lead to a critical fire threat.Las Vegas was included in the risk zone for the fire danger.The most recent heat wave was focused over portions of the Four Corners, desert Southwest and Southern and Central California. Next week, however, the area of most exceptional heat could park over northern California and the Pacific Northwest.This will lead to another week with a high risk of wildfires due to the already desiccated landscape void of much precipitation whether falling from the sky or locked in the mostly-melted snowpack.With ground fuels already sitting at highly flammable and record-dry levels, all experts can do is warn people of the impending danger and hope for the best in what has already proven to be an early and destructive start to the Western wildfire season.With climate change making heat waves three times more likely compared to 100 years ago and contributing to the current 22-year megadrought, wildfire seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer into the year. As the gap closes, experts say there isn't so much a defined wildfire season in the West anymore, but instead it lasts year round.Kathryn Prociv is a senior meteorologist and producer for NBC News."

The cause of the fire, which started Tuesday on Apache tribal land, remains under investigation.As of Sunday afternoon, a second blaze, the Telegraph Fire, had burned through more than 34,000 acres of shrub and grassland west of the Mescal Fire.Top of the World, a community of a few hundred people , was evacuated Sunday morning, the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said.

""If we get into another big ... heating event like we saw last year, our numbers tell us the grid will be stressed again.""More than 800,000 homes and businesses lost power over two days in August last year during a punishing heat wave that affected California and nearby states. It was the first time in 20 years that the ISO ordered widespread rolling blackouts.This year, to avoid a repeat scenario, energy regulators have acquired an additional 3,500 megawatts of capacity, including 2,000 megawatts of 4-hour lithium-ion batteries that can store energy generated from renewable sources. One megawatt is enough to power hundreds of homes.Even with the backup batteries, California residents should expect to hear from utility companies about how they can better conserve energy during the hottest months, Mainzer said.""Does that mean we are in the clear? Not necessarily,"" Mainzer told state lawmakers this month in an oversight hearing. ""The most significant risk factor for grid reliability remains extreme heat, particularly heat that spreads across the wider Western United States. And it continues to get hotter every year.""In 2018, California lawmakers set the goal of requiring the state's electricity system to become carbon-free by 2045. A recent report by the California Energy Commission found that the state would need to triple its grid capacity to meet the deadline.More than 60 percent of California's electricity is carbon-free, with about 36 percent of that coming from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, the report said.""Achieving 100 percent clean electricity by 2045 is not only a bold pursuit, but a wise one,"" Marybel Batjer, president of the California Public Utility Commission, said in a statement. ""Such action is required to avoid the worst impacts and costs of climate change and to ensure the delivery of safe, affordable, reliable and clean power to all Californians.""But as the most populous state races toward a sustainable future, officials remain concerned that California's aging infrastructure is not up to the task.Robert Foster, former president of Southern California Edison, questioned whether the state's mandate to make all new passenger vehicles zero-emission by 2035 could overburden an already strained power grid.""We're asking people to go to electric vehicles. We're asking people to electrify their homes, electrify their ports, electrify industry,"" he said Thursday, adding that he has driven electric cars for more than 20 years. ""You plug a modern electric vehicle in your home, it's like adding an additional house in terms of the load on the system.""State Sen. Mike McGuire, a Democrat who presents parts of Northern California, repeatedly blasted Pacific Gas & Electric in Thursday's roundtable over its mishandling of power outages in 2019 and for contributing to multiple massive wildfires in recent years that killed more than 100 people and destroyed thousands of structures.On Wednesday, the utility company was fined nearly $150 million for its part in the Kincade Fire, which destroyed more than 100 homes in Sonoma County in 2019; the Zogg Fire, which killed four people in Shasta County in September; and blackouts that affected 50,000 people, The Associated Press reported.PG&E has also pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter after faulty equipment contributed to the destruction of an entire community, Paradise in Butte County, during the Camp Fire of 2018.""America's largest utility is one of the most dysfunctional utilities, unfortunately, in the nation,"" McGuire said. ""It's incredibly frustrating, because what we're going to see, based on their lack of vegetation management in the most high-risk fire zones ... is the same communities in Northern California hit year after year for the next 10 years.""The state's power dilemma is an unwelcome addition to the growing list of grievances that Gov. Gavin Newsom will have to tackle as a recall effort continues. In 2003, California's energy crisis contributed to the downfall of Gov. Gray Davis, who was ousted in a recall election and replaced by Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger.""This is not Gov. Newsom's problem,"" Foster said.

62,'Ground zero for attrition': California federal fire crews understaffed amid increased fire threat,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ground-zero-attrition-california-federal-fire-crews-understaffed-fire-threat-n1267882,Thu May 20 2021 08:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"As Western states head into what experts say could be another catastrophic fire season, federal wildland firefighters are faced with staffing shortages amid a worsening drought and an exhausted workforce.The problem is especially acute in California, where fire activity is already increasing compared to this time last year. Among the most skilled and experienced teams, colloquially known as hotshots, only 70 percent of crews are expected to be fully staffed this year, said the union that represents federal firefighters. In some cases, understaffed fire engines will go unused, some of them at the Lake Tahoe Basin management unit in South Lake Tahoe near Eldorado National Forest.""It's an overall loss,"" said Ben Elkind, a U.S. Forest Service smokejumper. ""You're going to lose hotshot crews. You're going to lose smokejumpers. You're going to lose all the things states can't provide. If you have a California that doesn't have a federal workforce anymore, it's going to affect every state.""The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said the state has had 2,436 fires this year through mid May, compared to 1,554 during the same period last year.Despite the increased threat, the Forest Service does not expect to meet its goal of hiring 5,200 federal firefighters in California this year.""It will be below that number,"" said Bob Baird, director of fire and aviation management for the Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region. ""With hiring challenges and attrition, it could be a lower percentage than that, but we won't know until we finish our hiring process.""The gnawing problem of staff shortages has been an ongoing issue for the Forest Service, which classifies firefighters as ""forestry technicians"" who are not given similar pay or benefits afforded to state, municipal or even utility firefighters. Many are hired as seasonal employees who work six months of the year, often in life-threatening and mentally challenging environments.Federal firefighters have long complained that they are overworked and underpaid, and some have said they are ready to move on.""California is ground zero for attrition,"" said Riva Duncan, a former Forest Service officer who is the executive secretary of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, which advocates for federal fire personnel. ""We're losing people at an accelerated rate because there are so many other opportunities.""Forest Service firefighters' pay is based on the federal pay scale. Most start at the GS-3 level, at which pay tops out at around $31,000 annually for full-time employees. By comparison, a first-year firefighter with Cal Fire makes nearly twice as much.Most rank-and-file temporary seasonal workers start at an hourly base salary of about $13 per hour, plus overtime and hazard pay. California's current minimum wage is also $13, but it is scheduled to increase to $15 an hour by 2023, making state or local agencies a more attractive option in a region where the median home price is more than $800,000, according to the California Association of Realtors.""California has one of the highest cost of living rates in the country,"" said Randy Moore, regional forester for the Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region. ""It really presents a real challenge to firefighters.""Wildfires charred more than 4 million acres across California last year, destroying hundreds of structures and blanketing much of the state in heavy, dense smoke for several weeks. This year, the state is already beset by ""acute water supply shortages,"" prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare a drought emergency this month for 41 of the state's 58 counties.With increasingly worrisome conditions, state and municipal fire departments are beefing up their workforces to prepare for a heightened fire season, offering competitive salaries and benefits that struggling federal firefighters can find hard to resist.This year, Cal Fire will hire 1,400 more firefighters after Newsom authorized more than $80 million in emergency funds in March to bolster wildfire response efforts. Newsom has also proposed to invest $2 billion in his revised budget for emergency preparedness, including buying firefighting airplanes and helicopters, as well as creating a center to forecast wildfire threats.According to an internal survey conducted by Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, the most common reason engine crews had vacancies last year was that people were leaving for Cal Fire. Municipal and county departments were also listed as drivers for leaving the Forest Service, followed by job opportunities with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the utility company that pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter for causing the deadly, massive Camp Fire in 2018.""I couldn't wait any longer,"" said former Forest Service hotshot Aaron Humphrey, who left the federal agency last year and now works for PG&E. ""I had to really think some things through, and basically I was at a breaking point.""Humphrey, who joined the Forest Service when he was 18 years old, said leaving the agency was one of the hardest decisions he has ever made. After 25 years as a hotshot, Humphrey decided that he wanted ""another lease on life.""""All of a sudden, I had kids, and I look at how many years I have left to enjoy with them. I needed to be there to support my wife and to be a parent,"" he said.Another former federal firefighter who works at Cal Fire said he was attracted to his current job as a battalion chief because it allowed him to continue managing his family's cattle ranch in Northern California while still working to protect the land.Despite a statewide interagency agreement among departments that oversee wildland, California is ultimately paying the price for a shortage of federal crews, said the battalion chief, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency.""There was a point last summer when we had six Cal Fire teams assigned to five federal incidents,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, the Forest Service is going to continue to lose staffing until they catch up with the other agencies in California.""Moore of the Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region said that when federal crews are down, the agency will call in firefighters from other national forests or state agencies. But as wildland fires increase in frequency and intensity, the agency will continue to struggle to catch up with demand.""In one regard, that's OK, because it's still the firefighting community here in California protecting California,"" he said. ""But ... we have to continue to hire new, new, new and then train, train, train. We recognize that here in the Forest Service we need to address some of these issues.""Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

Jim Braden told a Spectrum News reporter that deputies did not have evidence to charge the man, and he said what appeared on the app was potentially ""disastrous"" because it could lead to someone's getting hurt.In a statement, Citizen said it was a ""mistake"" to have posted the photo, which came from a tipster, without ""formal"" coordination with authorities.""Once we realized this error, we retracted the photo and reward offer,"" the company said. ""Safety has always been, and remains, our top priority. Yesterday, we lost our way. We've learned from this, and we will be better. We unequivocally discourage anyone from putting themselves in danger or interfering with first responders' work, and condemn all forms of violence.""A spokeswoman for the sheriff's department referred questions about Braden's comments to the station where he works. Lt. Anna Carrillo, the watch commander on duty Sunday, declined to comment and referred questions to the Los Angeles Police Department, which has jurisdiction over the area where the fire started.The police department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The fire, which was 0 percent contained Sunday, was ignited in fierce wind gusts and a severe drought that stretches across most of the state. California experienced its most destructive wildfire season on record last year, a result of climate change and a century of fire suppression.Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, said last week that the state's vegetation had already reached peak summer dryness and that much of the state was at ""exceptionally high risk"" for wildfires this year.Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."

Gavin Newsom on Friday unveiled a revised budget proposal that includes what his office said is record spending for emergency preparation efforts amid another drought and a water crisis at the Oregon border.With more than 4 million acres burned, California experienced its most destructive fire season last year, but this year is looking like it could be worse, and the state officials are scrambling to replace a shrinking number of inmate hand crews.Newsom's response is to ""make the single largest investment in wildfire preparedness in our state’s history — $2 billion in emergency preparedness investments,"" his office said in a statement after announcing his proposal for the 2021-22 fiscal year that begins July 1.Kate Dargan, a former fire chief and current chair of the nonprofit California Fire Safe Council, called it ""the largest expenditure any state has ever spent on focused wildfire preparedness.""""It is a game-changing amount of money,"" she said.The sum would be on top of about $3 billion in annual base funding for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said deputy state fire marshal Lynne Tolmachoff. The extra $2 billion would be shared with the state Office of Emergency Services and the California Military Department, she said.The governor's office said the money will be used for firefighting equipment, including airplanes and helicopters, and land management, including helping residents create defensible space around their homes.Tolmachoff said it would also go toward hiring hand crews after Covid-19 and lower incarceration rates reduced the number of hands from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.""It makes a huge difference with the loss of inmate crews over the last two years,"" she said.Newsom, who is facing a recall election challenge, has a $76 billion budget surplus to work with. He is also proposing more cash payments to residents, rent relief and $8.75 billion to house the growing number of homeless people in the state.Republican challenger Kevin Faulconer said through a spokesman that the proposals show Newsom is ""desperate to convince voters that he's finally doing his job.""California has been beset by a number of catastrophic fire seasons in recent years. In 2018, the state experienced its most destructive season to date, but 2020 took that title by more than doubling the number of acres burned.Yet state fire officials are dreading the drought conditions this year, which they say are worse than 2020's. On Thursday, the federal Climate Prediction Center said sometimes rainy El Niño weather conditions would remain at bay through fall.Dargan, of the California Fire Safe Council, praised Newsom for a proposed budget she said ""really acknowledges this is a long game.""""It invests in several solutions before the tide turns,"" she said.Dennis Romero writes for NBC News and is based in Los Angeles."
66,A giant sequoia in California is still smoldering from last year's wildfires,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/giant-sequoia-california-still-smoldering-last-years-wildfires-rcna866,Fri May 07 2021 18:16:29 GMT+0000 (UTC),"Deep within California's Sequoia National Park, one of the state's iconic redwood trees is still smoldering from last year's devastating wildfires, according to the National Park Service.The burning giant sequoia was found by scientists and fire crews with the National Park Service, who were conducting surveys in the area to assess damage from the 2020 Castle Fire, which broke out in August and scorched more than 150,000 acres of land.The smoldering sequoia does not currently pose a threat to life or property, but it does demonstrate ""how dry the park is,"" said Leif Mathiesen, assistant fire management officer for Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.""With the low amount of snowfall and rain this year, there may be additional discoveries as spring transitions into summer,"" Mathiesen said in a statement.Much of California is in the grips of a worsening drought. Huge swaths of the state, including the areas in and around Sequoia National Park, are under ""extreme drought"" conditions, indicating that water reservoirs are ""extremely low,"" according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.The dry conditions have states in the western U.S. bracing for what experts say could be another active wildfire season. Last year's record-setting wildfires engulfed millions of acres across Washington state, Oregon, California and Colorado. In California alone, nearly 10,000 separate fires in 2020 scorched 4.2 million acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.Scientists have predicted that devastating wildfires will become more frequent and intense in a warming world, particularly as drought conditions persist and create the ingredients necessary to turn forests into tinderboxes.The 2020 Castle Fire was thought to have been caused by a lightning strike. The fire spread to at least 10 sequoia groves in the region, but it's not known how many trees — including some that were hundreds of years old — were destroyed.But sequoias are a fire-adapted species, and low-intensity blazes can actually help these forests thrive by breaking open cones from giant sequoias that release their seeds. In recent years, however, drought conditions combined with high-intensity fires have threatened these groves, according to the U.S. Forest Service.The still-smoking tree in Sequoia National Park is located in the Board Camp Grove, which the National Park Service said is away from any trails. Agency officials added, however, that the smoldering sequoia ""may be still visible from the Ladybug Trail which leaves east bound from the South Fork Campground at the southern end of Sequoia National Park.""Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on general science and climate change."

Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho. ""However, the human cost is far greater.""Much of the West is experiencing severe to exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, fueling concerns about another hot and dry summer.More than 98 percent of California was experiencing some level of drought this week, compared to 42 percent this time last year, NBC Los Angeles reported. Meanwhile, about 75 percent of the West is in a ""megadrought"" as waterways, including the Colorado River and the Rio Grande, which supply water for millions of people and businesses, are showing low flows.Despite warnings from experts, congressional leaders remain split over how to address the crisis. While some point to climate change, others blame forest management. Some lawmakers are pushing for federal agencies to hire more wildland firefighters, but others want states to take proactive roles in securing communities.""We must dispel the notion that there is nothing we can do,"" Fulcher said. ""Too frequently many of my friends on the other side of the aisle have blamed climate change for an ever-growing multitude of sins, including wildfires, while ignoring the real culprit of our present disaster: Decades of insufficient forest management, not climate change, have led to led to overgrown, diseased and dying forests.""Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., countered that Congress must stop the ""drain"" of federal resources to land agencies and increase the federal wildland workforce. But at the heart of the issue, Neguse said, is climate change.""For those of us who live in the West, wildfires are one of the most immediate and obvious impacts of climate change,"" he said. ""Wildfires today are nearly a year-round risk, burning larger areas at higher intensity, and this is only projected to increase as the climate continues to warm.""Neguse's district in and around Denver was hit last year by two of the largest wildfires in Colorado's history. The Cameron Peak Fire tore through more than 208,000 acres in Arapaho and Roosevelt national forests in Larimer and Jackson counties, as well as Rocky Mountain National Park, forcing more than 20,000 residents to evacuate. The East Troublesome Fire claimed nearly 200,000 acres and killed two people, NBC affiliate KUSA reported.Dave Daley, an animal science expert and rancher from Butte County in Northern California, testified that he had experienced historic wildfires up close. His family has raised cattle in Plumas National Forest since a great-grandfather moved to California during the Gold Rush.Last year, he lost most of his cow herd in the Bear Fire, which metastasized and became part of the devastating North Complex Fire, which burned more than 300,000 acres across Plumas and Butte counties.""Until you experience that, it's really difficult for me to explain the devastation that occurred,"" he said with a shaky voice. ""Not only was my cow herd destroyed — the legacy of my family, my home, the entire ecosystem in the Plumas National Forest was devastated.""Daley also witnessed the devastation wrought by the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and costliest fire in California's history. The inferno spread through more than 153,000 acres and killed 85 people, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Ignited by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. equipment, the fire caused $16 billion in damage.In neighboring Berry Creek, an entire town was destroyed and at least 14 people were killed in September in the Bear Fire. Two years before the fire leveled Berry Creek, the community had been selected to receive an $836,000 state grant to prune vegetation and clear fuel from potential fire spots, The Associated Press reported. But the forest management project was never completed because of red tape over vegetation thinning and pruning projects near two areas that became ground zero for the larger North Complex Fire.During Thursday's hearing, Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., slammed what he characterized as the bureaucratic quagmire that halted the project and said Congress must streamline the environmental review process.Daley's ""devastating testimony should serve as a wake-up call to all of us as legislators,"" he said. ""There is much frustration and much unnecessary loss in the West.""LaMalfa is among a handful of lawmakers pushing to reclassify federal forestry technicians as wildland firefighters. Currently, seasonal workers employed by the U.S. Forest Service to fight fires do not get the same wages, benefits or protections offered to state and municipal firefighters.In September, LaMalfa introduced the Federal Wildland Firefighter Recognition Act, which would direct the Office of Personnel Management to develop a separate and distinct wildland firefighter occupational series for employees whose main duties and responsibilities are fire prevention and suppression. The bill has been introduced several times over the years and failed. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate in 2019.Riva Duncan, a former Forest Service officer who is the executive secretary of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an association that advocates for federal fire personnel, shared emotional testimony about the toll that increasingly dangerous fires are having on the men and women who dedicate their lives to protecting communities.""People are at their breaking point, leaving a wake of mental health issues, suicides, high divorce rates and very concerning numbers surrounding high incidents of cancer and cardiovascular disease,"" she said.

She was never heard from again, police said.Online court records show Serriteno is represented by a public defender but do not appear to identify an attorney by name.The Markley Fire merged with a larger fire, the Hennessy Fire, which was eventually considered part of the massive ""LNU Lightning Complex.""That larger complex of fires was a result of two days of lightning strikes and is considered one of the largest wildfires in California history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire.The LNU Complex burned more than 363,000 acres across five counties, destroyed almost 1,500 structures, and is blamed in six deaths.That LNU complex was fully contained in early October. It burned in Lake, Napa, Sonoma, Yolo and Solano counties.Cal Fire said in a report that the 2020 fire season will be counted as one of the most severe in the history of the United States.In California, the ""2020 Fire Siege"" burned 4.2 million acres; killed 31 people, including three firefighters; and destroyed more than 9,200 structures.CORRECTION (April 29, 2021, 2:35 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the date of full containment for the LNU Lightning Complex.

69,'All kinds of damage': Blood samples show effects of wildfire smoke on human health,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/tiny-smoke-particles-make-wildfires-particularly-harmful-human-health-rcna729,Fri Apr 23 2021 17:29:26 GMT+0000 (UTC),"When the San Francisco Bay Area experienced a record 30 consecutive days of worrisome air quality alerts in August and September, Mary Prunicki began taking blood samples from firefighters.The sky had turned orange from nearby wildfires. Thousands of firefighters would spend months battling the blazes, which would eventually scorch more than 4 million acres and kill 31 people.And the damage isn't likely to have stopped there. Prunicki, director of air pollution and health research at Stanford University's Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research, is studying the blood samples to understand what wildfire smoke does to human health. It's part of a growing body of work that illustrates how wildfire seasons made worse by climate change threaten not just immediate destruction but also long-term health.She and other scientists are particularly concerned about a type of particulate matter in wildfire smoke known as PM2.5. These tiny airborne particles, about one-twentieth the width of a human hair, are especially dangerous because they can be breathed deeply into the lungs.""The size of that particulate can, when you inhale it, go all the way to the base of your lungs and then cross over into your bloodstream,"" Prunicki said. “Once it's in the bloodstream, it can go to various organs and do all kinds of damage.""Experts have said that in a warming world, devastating wildfires like the ones that tore across California, Oregon and Washington last year will be more common. Around the world, wildfire seasons have been starting earlier and lasting longer, becoming in some regions an almost year-round threat.In addition to being more frequent, studies have shown that climate change is making the blazes more intense and destructive.The results of Prunicki's study are forthcoming, but a clearer picture is emerging of just how damaging wildfire smoke can be to humans, and scientists are sounding the alarm over a problem they say is only going to get worse with climate change.""In the climate science community, we've been predicting these types of impacts for decades now,"" said Tom Corringham, an environmental economist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Corringham co-authored a study published last month in the journal Nature Communications that found that airborne particles in wildfire smoke can be several times more harmful to human respiratory health than other forms of air pollution, including car exhaust.It's not yet well understood why wildfire smoke is more harmful than other forms of ambient air pollution, although it is likely to have something to do with the chemical composition of what's being burned, Prunicki said. Wildfires that engulf homes and other buildings, for instance, can be particularly dangerous because the chemicals in furniture, clothing and other everyday items are released. In some cases, the materials in firefighters' protective gear can also release harmful particulate matter. Tony Stefani, a retired San Francisco fire captain, knows the risks well. Stefani, who in 2006 founded the San Francisco Firefighters Cancer Prevention Foundation, was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer. He recalled wondering whether his illness was somehow linked to his line of work.""I knew there was definitely something wrong,"" Stefani said. ""And I thought there was a direct correlation between what I had and my exposures on the job.""Many of his colleagues, Stefani said, accept that developing cancer is not a matter of if but when. Studies by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have shown that firefighters are at higher risk of cancer and cancer-related deaths compared to the general population, but researchers want to know why — and how best to protect them. Through his foundation, Stefani works to spread the word about early detection and prevention, but he's also involved with scientific efforts such as Prunicki's research to better understand how exactly wildfire smoke affects immune functioning and human health. While firefighters are among the most vulnerable when it comes to smoke exposure, it's not just those on the front lines battling blazes who are feeling the impacts of more frequent and intense wildfires.Studies have observed increases in hospitalizations, particularly for respiratory conditions, during wildfire events. In their study, Corringham and his colleagues combed through 14 years of hospital admissions records in Southern California, analyzing them together with satellite data on wildfire smoke and wind.The researchers discovered that an increase of PM2.5 pollution from wildfire smoke caused respiratory-related hospital admissions to increase by 1.3 percent to 10 percent. An increase in PM2.5 from other sources of air pollution, on the other hand, contributed to only a 1 percent rise in hospital admissions.Their findings suggest air quality standards may need to take into account differences in toxicity between different forms of air pollution, said a co-author of the study, Rosana Aguilera, a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.""If there are different impacts of PM2.5 on health, depending on where this PM2.5 is coming from, then we should study that further and reflect that in standards and policies for air pollution,"" she said.A study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Dermatology also found that wildfire smoke can exacerbate more than just respiratory conditions. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco observed a rise in the number of patients visiting health clinics for eczema and other general skin concerns in November 2018, when the catastrophic Camp Fire raged in Northern California.The scientists found that even short-term exposure to hazardous particulate matter in wildfire smoke can have consequences for skin health.The studies of the health effects of wildfire smoke paint a concerning picture of a future in which climate change is expected to supercharge wildfire seasons.That realization, Stefani said, makes his foundation's collaboration with scientists all the more important, because science can help advocates push for safer working conditions and better public health measures.""They're the impetus for change,"" Stefani said of the studies. ""That is the reason that we know there's a problem. When we have the scientific proof that something's wrong and we have the numbers to show it, change can occur. And that's really, really important.""Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on general science and climate change.Steve Patterson is a correspondent in Los Angeles for NBC News."

Gavin Newsom struck a deal with lawmakers Thursday to free up $536 million for wildfire prevention as the state faces more drought and an elevated fire risk that experts warn could be as catastrophic as last year's historic infernos.The money would provide improved prevention for all parts of California and would pay for forest maintenance, defensible space, home hardening and vegetation management.“With California facing another extremely dry year, it is critical that we get a head start on reducing our fire risk,"" said Newsom, Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon in a joint statement.In a tweeted statement, Atkins added that every dollar spent on prevention ""saves $6-$7 in damage.""""But, this is about more than money,"" she said in the tweet. ""It's about lives, homes, and livelihoods.""Last month, Newsom authorized more than $80 million in emergency funds to hire an additional 1,400 firefighters with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, to bolster fuels management and wildfire response efforts. Newsom’s 2021 budget proposed $1 billion to support wildfire and forest management, according to the governor's office.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot applauded the state's firefighting efforts but said more needs to be done as climate change continues to threaten the environmental outlook.""The science is clear: Warming winter temperatures and warming summer temperatures are creating more dangerous and challenging wildfire conditions,"" he said. ""Clearly much more needs to be done on a proactive, upfront basis to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire.""Crowfoot added he expects this summer to be ""more of the same"" as last year.""We can't sugarcoat the fact that this summer is going to be challenging,"" he said. ""We are just getting out of our second consecutive dry winter.""The wildfire prevention measures come on the heels of a catastrophic fire season last year that charred more than 4 million acres across the state, destroyed hundreds of structures and blanketed much of the state in heavy, dense smoke for several weeks.On Thursday, the National Weather Service warned that 92 percent of California is experiencing drought conditions. Severe drought conditions are especially troublesome in Southern California, which received below-average rain through the winter months.The latest U.S. Drought Monitor map released today shows 92% of CA in a #drought category (D1-D4). Severe drought (D2 - orange) conditions were expanded across portions of #SoCal in this week’s map. For more info visit: https://t.co/QXnSqv6OXu #CAwx #LaNina pic.twitter.com/lzTeSWFyG5According to the National Integrated Drought Information System, recent warm and dry weather has led to early and accelerated snowmelt throughout much of the West. More than 99 percent of the state is in the abnormally dry or drought category, fueling concerns about what could happen when temperatures soar into the triple digits as they did last year.Last month, California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla and 21 members of Congress sent a letter to the Agriculture and Interior departments asking to transition their agencies to a year-round firefighting workforce as fire seasons increasingly turn into fire years.The letter asks the two departments to reclassify more seasonal firefighters as permanent. Currently, most wildland firefighters work only during the traditional fire season, which historically ran for about six months out of the year. Many of those firefighters are classified as forestry technicians who do not receive the same pay and benefits as state and local firefighters.“As California and the West continue to contend with historic and destructive wildfire seasons, it has become clear that we are entering a ‘new normal’ in which increasingly intense wildfires wreak havoc during a nearly year-round fire season,” the lawmakers said in the letter.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

Tony Evers said. Incoming weather conditions, such as gusty winds and low humidity levels, are also more conducive to wildfire spread.""With nearly the entire state experiencing high or very high fire risk, protecting Wisconsinites from the destructive dangers of wildfires is a top priority,"" Evers said.Spring wildfire season in Wisconsin typically runs through the end of May, the governor's office said.The executive order, which Evers signed Monday, allows the National Guard to mobilize with the state's Department of Natural Resources, which handles wildfire response. The department said in a release Saturday that the majority of counties are at very high risk of fire danger.Annual burning permits have been suspended, the department said Saturday.""To help us keep Wisconsinites safe, the DNR is asking you to avoid all outdoor burning including limiting the use of campfires and making sure to extinguish and dispose of cigarettes properly,"" the release said. ""Outdoor enthusiasts should also use caution with off-road vehicles or equipment that can create a spark and start a fire.""A state Department of Natural Resources spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Experts said last week that large parts of the country are preparing for another potentially dangerous wildfire season.Last year, millions of acres burned in a record wildfire season that was focused primarily in the western half of the country, in states such as California, Washington and Oregon.

72,"Western states brace for 'very active wildfire season' following warm, dry winter",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/western-states-brace-very-active-wildfire-season-following-warm-dry-n1262946,Fri Apr 02 2021 23:02:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"The western half of the country is bracing for a hot, dry and potentially dangerous wildfire season that appears to be already underway in several states.The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings on Friday for much of the Great Plains, including North Dakota, where a large wildfire Thursday threatened homes and forced people to evacuate.A red flag warning means critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will shortly. “A combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can contribute to extreme fire behavior,” the National Weather Service said on its website.All 11 western states have areas currently experiencing severe or extreme drought conditions, including North and South Dakota, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.""The Southwest U.S., which is already experiencing widespread severe to exceptional drought, will remain the hardest hit region in the U.S., and water supply will continue to be a concern this spring in these drought-affected areas,"" Mary Erickson, deputy director of the National Weather Service, said in a statement.The ongoing hot, dry weather is adding to concern that this year’s fire season could be similar or worse to previous seasons.""We are preparing for the fire year,"" said Stanton Florea, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center.As a result of the increasingly dry vegetation, the National Interagency Fire Center recorded an increase in fire activity across the United States in March, especially in the Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions. Above-normal fire activity is expected to continue across the northern Plains through April and into early May.“Things can change but we do expect the potential for another very active wildfire season in the West,” Florea said. “At this point, it’s those drought conditions and dry vegetation that are driving that.”As of Friday, nearly 1,800 firefighters had already mobilized to battle at least 19 different blazes in the Upper Plains, Rockies, Great Lakes and Southwest regions, Florea added. This does not include firefighters on prescribed, or controlled, burns.“That is a pretty substantial number for this time of year,” he said.The national preparedness level, which is dictated by fuel and weather conditions, jumped from 1 to 2 this week, allowing fire agencies to free up more resources and prepare for increased fire activity. Last year's preparedness level didn't increase until June, Florea said.Across the country, record-breaking wildfires are becoming increasingly common as temperatures spike and droughts worsen, leaving brush dry, overgrown and flammable.On Thursday, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum declared a statewide fire emergency because of drought conditions that fueled a large wildfire near the tourist town of Medora, where at least 100 residents were forced to evacuate.There were no reports of injuries or damaged structures in the community, near the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Burgum said during a news briefing on Friday, but critical fire conditions are expected to continue through much of the day, according to the North Dakota Forest Service. Red flag warnings were also issued throughout the week for much of the state.North Dakota has already seen a growing number of wildfires combined with extreme drought conditions, The Associated Press reported. The North Dakota Forest Service has tracked more than 140 wildfires that have burned over 46 square miles.In neighboring South Dakota, a wildfire threatened communities in Pennington County and forced residents in more than 400 homes to evacuate earlier in the week.The increased fire threat comes after a historic wildfire season in 2020 that scorched millions of acres in California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and beyond. In the past decade, California has seen eight of the 10 largest fires in the state’s history, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis, devastating communities and drawing tens of millions of dollars from the state’s budget.Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom authorized more than $80 million in emergency funds to hire an additional 1,400 firefighters with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, to bolster fuels management and wildfire response efforts. Newsom’s 2021 budget proposed $1 billion to support wildfire and forest management, according to the governor's office.“Fire season can be at any time,” said Carrie Bilbao, a spokeswoman with the Bureau of Land Management who also works with the National Interagency Fire Center. “We just don't really have those wet seasons consistently anymore.”One piece of good news is that Alaska, usually among the first states to see wildfires each year, is not experiencing an uptick in 2021, Bilbao said.“Alaska usually burns first and then the Southwest, eastern areas in Texas and Florida,” she said, adding that fire experts are “not panicking yet.”“It’s just one of those things where you never know,” she said. “Especially with the dry fuels and winds, of course you’re going to have increased fire danger. You just plan for the worst.”Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."
73,'They left us out to dry': Wildland firefighter says he was 'blacklisted' for speaking against lack of Covid safety,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/they-left-us-out-dry-wildland-firefighter-says-he-was-n1260302,Sat Mar 13 2021 09:30:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"A wildland firefighter is suing the U.S. Forest Service, claiming that he was “blackballed” after speaking out publicly about loose coronavirus safety regulations during last year's historic fire season that scorched millions of acres across several Western states.According to a complaint filed with the U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Pedro Rios, a firefighter with 13 years experience, was “discriminated and retaliated against due to protesting lack of COVID-19 protocols and protections for the fire crew, families and the public.”Rios says he was denied rehire rights, the hiring process federal firefighters undergo each fire season, after he publicly criticized his boss's handling of safety guidelines.He also filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel alleging that his free speech rights as a public employee were violated. Both complaints were received in February and investigations are ongoing, according to his lawyer, Tom Dimitre.In an emailed statement, the Forest Service declined to comment on pending litigation and said “as a matter of policy, we do not discuss personnel matters.”The federal complaints stem from a message Rios posted to a Facebook community page in July. In the post, he warned residents of his small Northern California county that his fire crew would be returning home to the Klamath National Forest without first quarantining after spending a week in Southern California, which was considered a Covid-19 hot spot during the summer and for many months after.“We chose this job and know the dangers, bringing us back to Siskiyou exposing an older public population and our own families is absolutely short sighted in our view,” he wrote in the post.He went on to post a screenshot showing the names of Klamath National Forest officers whom community members could contact with questions or concerns.Even before the coronavirus pandemic spread throughout the country, Rios worried about his son’s compromised health and what could happen if the 4-year-old came down with a respiratory infection.Like both his mother and father, Felix Bell-Rios was born with severe asthma that can trigger attacks at a moment’s notice. In 2019, he was airlifted to an intensive care unit after a particularly vicious episode and spent two days in the hospital. He now uses Flovent medication and a nebulizer machine to keep his air passages clear.When Covid-19 arrived in the United States last year, Rios wondered what that would mean for the upcoming fire season and for his son’s safety. After talking it over with his girlfriend and members of his fire crew, he said he felt confident the Forest Service would have Covid-19 safety measures in place.But that was not his experience when fire season started, he said.His crew was given hand sanitizer and masks, but they were not instructed to quarantine before traveling to Southern California or after. Instead, his crew was told to self-isolate if they experienced symptoms after returning to Siskiyou County, a rural community near the Oregon border.Rios worried these mitigation plans were insufficient, he said. He and others in the crew used public bathrooms and grocery stores while in Los Angeles, and they did not wear masks around each other or while fighting fires.During his time in Southern California, he said, he voiced concerns to his managers that traveling to an urban region with high Covid-19 rates could endanger his son and elderly residents in Siskiyou County.“They left us out to dry,” he said of the Forest Service. “They didn’t care about us or our safety, the public’s safety, our children’s safety.”In an emailed statement, a spokesman for the Forest Service said that the federal agency “has and continues to take proactive steps to prioritize our employees' health and safety and the communities we serve.”“At the Regional level, a COVID-19 Emergency Response Team was comprised. That team created mitigation plans that included guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health organizations,” the spokesman, Nathan Judy, said.“In addition, each of the 18 national forests in CA has created incident management organizations tasked with developing guidance to address all aspects in response to the pandemic,” he added.Some of the safety protocols implemented during the pandemic included regular vehicle cleaning and disinfecting, allowing fire crews to sleep in hotels rather than at shared fire stations, hosting virtual briefings and limiting the number of firefighters who travel in the same vehicle, Judy said.Because the Forest Service is a federal agency, the organization largely takes its cues from the federal government. Last year, as the Trump administration downplayed concerns about the pandemic and health officials scrambled to understand the virus, the Forest Service took a piecemeal approach to Covid-19 safety regulations, allowing each national forest to implement its own guidelines specific to the needs of its region.One firefighter, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job, said his Arizona-based crew was largely left ""to its own devices"" when it came to Covid-19 safety. His team, which he described as ""left-leaning"" and ""science-believing,"" installed handwashing stations on the back of firetrucks, ate freeze-dried meals to limit grocery store visits and avoided traveling in shared vehicles when possible.""The USFS can barely manage public lands, let alone a public health emergency,"" he said. ""Our crew leadership was doing the best they could with the little information they had in hand.""Casey Judd, president of the Federal Wildland Fire Services Association, which advocates on behalf of federal firefighters, said he heard similar accounts from other firefighters last year. Because Covid-19 guidelines varied by crew, forest and even fire, many firefighters were forced to ""manufacture some common sense rules"" on their own.""Nobody knew what to do,"" he said. ""Everybody's looking for guidance and, of course, guidance is supposed to come from the top down and sometimes it didn't get there.""Rios’ fire crew had already spent four days fighting wildfires in the Angeles National Forest outside Los Angeles and the Cleveland National Forest near San Diego when he decided to post the message to Facebook.In the post, Rios said his supervisor was pushing for the fire crew to return home early because of the worsening coronavirus outbreak in Los Angeles.“Everyone on the strike team ... are perplexed and upset that he's trying to shorten our stay since we MAY or MAY NOT have been infected,” Rios wrote. “Why bring us back early and expose the public and our own families when we can still be utilized down here with covering for potential future fires (we've been dispatched to 3 fires in 4 days) between CNF and ANF.”Within a few hours of posting to Facebook, Rios said, he was questioned by his team leader who called his behavior “unprofessional” and warned him that he had “rocked the boat.”""I think it’s pretty unprofessional to come back to our families and the public after being exposed to Covid,"" he added.A few months later, he received a call saying that he would not be rehired for the following fire season.The Forest Service, which falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, manages roughly 30 percent of federal lands, the majority of them in the West. Every spring, the agency hires 12,000 seasonal employees, many of them as firefighters, to work from May through October. They must reapply for their jobs every year.Rios said no reason was given for not being rehired, but he suspects that he was “blacklisted” after voicing his concerns publicly.“I’m not the kind of guy who goes out looking for trouble, but they kind of forced my hand when they promised to have something in place and they didn’t,” he said.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

75,"First wildfires, now mudslides. California endures year-round disaster season.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/first-wildfires-now-mudslides-california-endures-year-round-disaster-season-n1256236,Sat Jan 30 2021 00:29:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"SALINAS, Calif. — It was 4 a.m. when Crystal Urite and her family were awakened by firefighters knocking at the door of her home in Monterey County.Mudslides were starting to flow in the burn scar left by last summer’s River Fire, and the firefighters recommended she evacuate. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Urite didn’t want to go to a crowded shelter. Thirty minutes later, her SUV was submerged in mud.The driveway was covered in thick sludge, which had blown through the garage door, lining the interior with rocks and debris picked up on the mudslide’s miles-long route through the coastal foothills south of the Santa Cruz Mountains.Many homes in Urite’s neighborhood that survived the 75-square-mile River Fire were damaged in a pattern as old as the California coastal ranges. But as the fire season grows longer in the West because of climate change, residents are finding that if they escape one disaster, they may not be so lucky during the next.“The fire was pretty scary, and I didn’t think the flood was going to be as bad,” Urite said of Wednesday’s mudslide, “but then we woke up to the water and everything overflowing.”Monterey County still had assessors in the field Friday, but at least 25 structures were damaged and nearly 8,000 residents were put under evacuation orders, said communications coordinator Maia Carroll. In Big Sur, a portion of scenic Highway 1 washed into the ocean Thursday night.More rain is forecast for parts of the state next week.In the recent downpour, Urite’s car was destroyed, and she needed a backhoe to clear her garage and driveway. The house directly uphill from hers was buried in 3 feet of debris Thursday with mud stains up to the roof. The house survived a fire season that burned thousands of square miles across California, only to be destroyed in the aftermath.Mudslides and wildfires are what scientists call concurrent disasters, with one setting the stage for another. After the worst fire season in California’s history last year, during which five of the six largest fires to burn in the state started within a two-month period, rainfall not only brings the wicked season to an end, but carries the possibility of more disaster.Sea level rise and stronger hurricanes are making flooding in the Southeast exponentially more dangerous, and drought in the Southwest is fueling the longer fire season.As the global climate continues to heat up, so does the reckoning with nature, experts say. In 2020, 22 natural disasters caused at least $1 billion in damages in the United States alone.“The heavy rainfall is always a challenge, but when you’ve got the fires and the rainfall within a few months of each other, even a few years of each other, you generate a whole new category of risks,” said Stanford University environmental studies professor Chris Field, who helped author a 2012 United Nations report on climate change and disaster risk around the world.Trees and plants usually stabilize the earth, but after a severe fire, nothing is left to keep the saturated soil in place, and the rain hits the ground uninterrupted by branches and plants instead of being distributed by root systems. Once the ground starts to slide, it’s difficult to stop, Field said.“It can really build momentum, like an avalanche does in snow,” he said, “and start spreading out soil over a very large area.”Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsUrite’s neighbor, Jarrod Domingos, who lives in the house his parents built, did not evacuate when the River Fire burned within 400 yards of his front door and waited with water trucks to defend his property in case the blaze jumped the firebreak.“It was a lot of sleepless nights,” Domingos said.When it was finally over, Domingos knew the area would need many small showers to stabilize the soil. So when a big storm was forecast for this week, he became nervous. Domingos and some of his neighbors went to Google Maps and calculated acreage of the drainage of the valley above his property. He decided it was small enough not to panic.“It's never an off-season when you're coming off a disaster,” said Domingos, whose home survived. “This is all to do with the fire. There’s just no cover up top. It looks like the moon up there.”Joe Purtell is a freelance journalist based in San Francisco."

Several nearby neighborhoods were evacuated and firefighters struggled to gain access because of hazardous tree conditions from the previous blaze, according to state fire officials.The Complex Fire started Aug. 16 after a barrage of lightning bolt strikes. Separate fires merged into a complex of blazes that charred more than 135 square miles across San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, NBC Bay Area reported. One person died.""We responded to many more fires overnight, but most have been contained and controlled,"" Santa Cruz fire officials said in a statement posted on Facebook. ""We have other smaller fires within the unit, but these listed are the top priority.""One of the two new wildfire starts in Santa Cruz County this morning visible on the Mt. Bielawski webcam (SW). #CaWx #CaFire pic.twitter.com/DQ0dzeBh9XEarlier Tuesday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said firefighters responded to at least 10 small vegetation fires in the last 12 hours. High winds knocked down power lines, trees and other debris in a region that has seen little to no rain this winter.The Santa Cruz Sentinel reported at least a dozen fires in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties over the last 24 hours.Officials have not determined what sparked Tuesday's fires.""This is the reality we've been living and it's one we've been going through for quite a few years now,"" said Issac Sanchez, Cal Fire battalion chief. ""We've noticed that the fire year gets extended further into the winter than it ever has before and it gets started earlier in the spring than it ever has before and that's the situation that we're sitting in right now.""Historically, peak fire season runs from July through October but climate change and forest mismanagement have contributed to hotter and deadlier fires that burn longer into the year.""We don't prepare for a fire season anymore,"" Sanchez said. ""We prepare for a fire year.""In the first few weeks of 2021, California has recorded 71 vegetation fires compared to 39 this time last year, according to Cal Fire. The five-year average for this time of year is 45 fires, Sanchez said.California's dry winter has only exacerbated the potential for more fires. Typically vegetation absorbs moisture from rain and snow in the winter months and then blossoms in the spring. But without precipitation, that vegetation remains dry and could become ""a recipe for disaster"" later in the year, Sanchez added.As of late December, the amount of water in California’s mountain snowpack was about half of average for early winter, state Department of Water Resources officials warned last year. The fall months were also unseasonably dry, especially in the Sierra Nevada mountain region, following below-average snow and precipitation in 2019.Meanwhile above average temperatures have been recorded in Southern California, which saw multiple days in the high 80s last week. The National Weather Service also recorded record-high temperatures in San Francisco and Oakland on Monday with temperatures in the 70s across most of the region.🔥 White Road at Freedom and Larkin Valley is closed due to #nunesfire pic.twitter.com/NYB6C9TrP7A fire weather warning is also in effect for parts of Southern California due to gusty winds and low humidity through Tuesday evening.In Bakersfield, the Wolf Fire rapidly burned more than 75 acres in the Wind Wolves Preserve nature conservancy Tuesday afternoon, threatening wildlife, including foxes and hares, and the plants needed to sustain them.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

Keene, founder of Practical Media Inc., has found that months of fires have exacerbated her 7-year-old son’s issues with depression, anxiety and ADHD, she told NBC News. The family did what they could to help him and Keene’s younger daughter find relief in an already high-stress pandemic until the fires’ relentless attack on the West Coast brought new triggers.“We would really try to do anything that would give them other places to go or other things to do or any of that, all that got destroyed as well,” Keene said. “So they couldn't even go outside, they couldn't even go to the tree house. They had to be inside, with the doors locked and purifiers on, so that started really making things worse.”Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsHer son, who she asked not to name because of his age, vocally expressed panic and fear once the fires became so intense that the skies around their Oakland home turned orange. Keene said her son feared an apocalypse, or zombie invasion, and asked to be kept in a room with no windows.“I sort of joke that like, possibly my son was the only person actually having a sane reaction,” Keene said. “I was like, ‘Well, you could call it a mental health crisis or you could call it sane.’”Keene herself has worked for years to manage her own anxiety and depression, which she feels has helped her children navigate their own emotions. But even she felt the stress of the fires, resulting in a panic attack while she was driving on the highway, with the bay on one side and Berkeley on the other.“It was like you were [in] this orange bubble and it looked like there was like the edge of the world, basically like you couldn't even see the bay that was right there,” Keene said. “It just looked like it was just going off into orange. And we're sort of stuck in that. And I just slowly started having a panic attack.”The year has seen record-breaking natural disasters, with storms that have battered the Atlantic and blazes that have scorched the West Coast. Scientists have tied the ever-worsening weather events to climate change, with warnings that the catastrophes will worsen without serious action to reduce the burning of coal, oil and gas.Research has shown that natural disasters can bring on a host of psychological distresses, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety, according to Dr. Steven Taylor, professor and clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia.“There's a concept called the burden of accumulated adversity. That is a way saying the more bad stuff that happens to you, the greater the odds are that you will develop serious mental health problems,” Taylor said. “And so, we've got these recurrent wildfires or hurricanes in the Atlantic, and they are not only occurring during a pandemic, they're actually interacting with the pandemic.”Taylor believes that natural disasters that are increasing in severity, frequency and unpredictability will have serious impacts on people's mental health issues and that authorities must factor mental health resources in to their crisis response plans.“You can use the data out there to map regions that are most vulnerable to mental health problems and the other regions that are likely to be most hardest hit by climate change,” Taylor said. “And so I think what our leaders need to do at health authorities is to proactively set up mental health resources for those particular regions.”Although the climate crisis has become an overwhelming source of stress for many people, Taylor says that an important step for the future is to not descend into helplessness. Communities coming together amid a crisis can not only help each other cope through the loss and fear, but also mobilize to create changes that reduce carbon footprints.Anxious passivity will only compound an issue that “no single person can address,” Taylor said.“Which, we've seen this during the pandemic where people are realizing, ‘oh, if we join together as a community and help one another, the burden seems lessened,’” Taylor said.Jamie Thrower grew up in Sonoma County, which was hit hard by the 2017 Tubbs Fire and again this fall with the Glass Fire. The 33-year-old photographer was living in Oakland three years ago when the Tubbs fire devastated her hometown as she rushed back to California from a trip in Portland, Oregon.Thrower said she threw herself into volunteering, trying her best to be helpful, but couldn’t shake the fear and need to be “hyper vigilant.”“It greatly impacts people, you know, from all circuits of it and whether or not you're in the middle of it or you're a couple of rings out,” Thrower said. “It still really permeates the community, and everyone's...mental health.”She called it “surreal” to watch her old neighborhood, with her friends, family and former classmates losing their homes. Thrower has since moved to Portland with her wife, but that hasn’t given her any refuge from the flames.This Oregon wildfire season has also been among the most destructive on record. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said in September that the fires in the state could mean the “greatest loss of human lives and property due to wildfire in our state's history.”Thrower and her wife have focused on doing what they can for those around them, offering each other some extra grace while experiencing the added stress of the fires, but it does seem to them that climate change is inescapable.“I don't know if it's actually possible to reverse anything that we've already done,” Thrower said. “But there is a way that we can stop the effects of it, or stop doing what we're doing now, and work to make a better climate so that we're not all suffering.”Doha Madani is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.

82,"Federal wildland firefighters say they're burned out after years of low pay, little job stability",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/federal-wildland-firefighters-say-they-re-burned-out-after-years-n1245576,Sat Oct 31 2020 10:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"What started as a single tree fire in the mountains of Idaho in 2012 quickly escalated into a smoke-filled inferno that surrounded United States Forest Service helicopter rappeller Jonathon Golden and his small team.Capable of accessing land that is too rugged or steep to reach by foot, rappel crews are the first to respond to wildfires buried deep within forests. Their goal is simple: stop small fires before they balloon out of control.Golden, who retired from the agency in 2019, was the first of his four-person team to rappel into the smoldering ridge. He remembers the smoke being so thick that not even the whirl of the helicopter improved visibility on the ground.Full coverage of the Western wildfires“One tree turned into five, five trees turned into 20. It was this cascade of fire erupting,” Golden said. “You could hear the unmistakable sound of a freight train of fire roaring up at you.”Golden, who was 30 years old at the time, had heard about previous firefighter fatalities in the region and didn’t want to take any chances. He was working to establish an escape route when one of his crew members went “rogue,” compromising the team’s ability to stay together.Using his radio, Golden asked for additional air support but other crews were tied up with their own attack plans. His team was forced to find its own way out.“I thought we were done, frankly,” Golden said. “I thought we were going to die.”Eight years later, Golden still cannot shake the experience. He was forced to leave behind his equipment and pack, including his wallet and many of his belongings. They were all destroyed in what was later named the Mustang Fire, which incinerated more than 300,000 acres in the Salmon-Challis National Forest.Golden was a temporary seasonal forestry technician at the time and never received treatment for what he thinks could be post-traumatic stress. He took just one day off to order a new bank card and was back at work the next day. When he tried to talk to his supervisor about the experience, he was told to move on: “You might as well forget about it.”Golden is just one of thousands of federal wildland firefighters who work six months out of the year and whose part-time status doesn’t come with the typical benefits or job security given to state and city firefighters.NBC News spoke with 27 current and former USFS firefighters with similar stories. Nearly all of them said they are grossly underpaid to perform life-threatening work. Many don’t have access to health care and other benefits, particularly during the off-season. They are not even considered to be firefighters, instead falling into a bureaucratic quagmire that designates them as forestry technicians. Some grimly joke that only in death does the agency recognize them as bona fide firefighters.“It takes us dying to get their attention,” said Riva Duncan, a forest management officer.Despite the low pay and benefits, many wildland firefighters said they can’t imagine a life outside fire. For some, the adrenaline rush becomes a kind of compulsion. For others, sleeping under the stars and protecting federal land is a higher calling.“For those of us who stick it out, our love for what we do outweighs everything,” said Duncan, who has been with the USFS for 37 years. “The sacrifices we have made — it’s because we believe in the mission.”Amid escalating fire threats fueled by climate change and forest mismanagement, these workers are now organizing and lobbying Congress in new ways. They are finding bipartisan support among some Western lawmakers, but many worry the federal agency that employs them is ill-equipped to provide adequate pay and benefits despite the dangerous nature of their jobs.According to the Congressional Research Service, as of Oct. 1, over 44,000 wildfires have burned nearly 7.7 million wildland acres this year alone. That’s more than 12,000 square miles, or an area about 1 1/2 times the size of New Jersey.Over the last decade, fire seasons have gradually turned into fire years. This year, more than 4 million acres have already burned in California alone, forcing thousands of evacuations and power outages across the state. Longer-burning fires have also resulted in more dangerous work. In September, a Hotshot squad leader was killed battling the El Dorado Fire in San Bernardino County, California.The USFS declined to make anyone in leadership available for an interview and did not directly address many of NBC News’ detailed questions.Babete Anderson, a spokeswoman for the USFS, said in a statement that the agency is “working to identify solutions by listening to our firefighters to ensure their needs are met.”“We need to treat the landscape at a much larger scale, 2-3 times what we do now, together with our partners,” she wrote. “Only then will we significantly reduce the threat of wildfire to communities, ensure our forests endure into the future and provide firefighters the safe spaces they need to respond.”It’s difficult to fully appreciate how large the American West is, and most don’t realize how much of it is federally owned and managed. Most states west of Kansas have substantial portions of their territory controlled by the federal government.The U.S. Forest Service, which operates under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is responsible for roughly 30 percent of all federal land: 193 million acres, or over 301,000 square miles, the overwhelming majority of it in the West. The total area of USFS-managed land is larger than the entire state of Texas by approximately 30,000 square miles.To oversee all of that land, and the 28,000 employees that work on it, the agency has an annual budget of $5.3 billion. Nearly half ($2.4 billion) of that budget is currently spent on “wildland fire management.” A 2015 USFS report estimated this cost will rise to over two-thirds of the agency’s annual budget by 2025, to the detriment of nearly all other agency priorities, including vegetation and watershed management, facilities maintenance and more.Every fire season, in the spring, USFS ramps up and hires an additional 12,000 seasonal employees, hired primarily for firefighting, most of whom have to reapply for their job each season.This seasonal employment model is one that many younger firefighters who spoke with NBC News lament: In the off-season, they seek work in fields as diverse as construction to farming to photography, and some even receive unemployment benefits.In the parlance of the agency, the bulk of the USFS firefighters are “1039s,” referring to the number of work hours they are capped at in a given season. That is just a single hour shy of six months of paid work, which means the federal government can classify those workers as temporary. They are not able to receive automatic health care, retirement or other benefits afforded to permanent employees.In practice, firefighters battling an active fire often end up working well beyond the 1,039 base hours with overtime, sometimes accruing up to an additional 1,000 hours.One current forest service employee, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said his low pay means he sometimes can’t afford basic necessities for his kids.“I struggle to put new shoes on my children as a temporary firefighter,” he said. “I had to look at my 6-year-old and tell her I couldn’t afford brand-new shoes for her while we were shopping at a thrift store after a complete season of firefighting.”USFS firefighter pay is dictated by the federal pay scale, where most start at the GS-3 level and where pay tops out at around $31,000 annually for full-time employees. By comparison, a first-year firefighter with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, better known as Cal Fire, makes nearly double that amount.Most rank-and-file temporary seasonal workers are starting at an hourly base salary of approximately $13 per hour plus overtime and hazard pay. One current USFS firefighter posted to Reddit recently showing that after eight years of service his gross pay topped out at around $30,000 annually.“What the federal government is doing is asking 20-year-olds to risk their lives for $13 to $15 and say, ‘Sayonara,’ with no retirement benefits, nothing,” said Brandon Dunham, a former USFS and Bureau of Land Management firefighter. “That is a human tragedy right there.”Dunham and others recently sent a letter to top senators seeking to “advocate for fair pay and wage equality,” among other requests for their ilk.The former “helitack” crew member — a type of wildland firefighter specializing in helicopter operations — has given up firefighting after 11 years, in favor of working construction, spending more time at home with his wife and hosting a podcast by and for wildland firefighters called “The Anchor Point Podcast.” He decided to leave the field as he felt there was no future for him there.When asked if he would like to return to wildland firefighting, with an agency like Cal Fire, Dunham did not hesitate.“I would go jump on a Cal Fire engine in a heartbeat,” he said.The Reno, Nevada, resident left the USFS at a time when, according to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service, an average of nearly 7 million acres of federal land has burned every year since 2000, more than double the average annual acreage burned during the 1990s.Beginning in the USFS 2019 Budget Justification document, even the USFS itself began remarking on the fact that there is now “year-round fire activity” rather than a traditional fire season. “The Nation is experiencing more extreme fire behavior and high risk, high cost wildfire suppression operations in the wildland-urban interface have progressively become the new normal over the last two decades,” the fiscal year 2021 document stated. “It is estimated that 63 million acres of National Forest System lands and 70,000 communities are at risk from uncharacteristically severe wildfires. Annually, there are typically more than 5,000 fires on National Forest System lands.”There is a rapidly increasing disconnect between the fiscal realities of firefighting (they are paid relatively little) and the ground truth: Fires are burning larger areas than ever before and these firefighters are in higher demand.“The bureaucracy of the federal government does not match the speed with which fire is changing,” said one USFS firefighter based in Oregon who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal.As fires have increased in frequency and intensity in recent years, fatalities among wildland firefighters have also increased. A 2014 Quadrennial Fire Review commissioned by the USFS and the Department of the Interior Office of Wildland Fire found that the 10-year moving average of wildland firefighter fatalities had nearly doubled in 40 years.Despite the increased fire threat, many wildland firefighters say they are not given the resources or protections necessary to continue working with the U.S. Forest Service year after year.It took Mike West a decade to become a full-time employee with the agency and even then finding treatment for his PTSD was difficult.“I had too many close calls,” he said. “I didn’t really want to be out in the field anymore.”In 2013, a childhood friend who worked as a smokejumper was killed by a limb from a burning tree. The loss devastated West and triggered an onslaught of symptoms — including anxiety, nightmares and depression — he later learned were caused by PTSD.“I just sort of covered it up,” he said. “At the time I thought it would be weak if I said anything, so I didn’t tell anybody.”Three years later the symptoms were worse. He developed short-term memory loss and decided to seek treatment through the USFS. The first counselor assigned to him did not have the necessary background to treat PTSD, West said. He found another doctor that could address his trauma but that therapist was located 90 miles away in Reno, Nevada.For six months West made the commute, which only exacerbated problems at home. He had two small children that he rarely saw and a wife who grew increasingly tired of juggling child care and her own full-time job.One night, after working an 18-hour shift as a dispatcher, West had enough.“It got to the point where I had to choose: Do I want to be a good family man and a bad firefighter or do I want to be a really good firefighter and bad with my family? I couldn’t find a balance,” he said.“More often than not, people leave because of the strain,” he added. “I don't know too many people who are married and still do the work.”West finally resigned from the Forest Service in July after 17 years with the agency and became a teacher. His final pay scale as a dispatcher came out to $21.50 an hour plus overtime. In his resignation letter, West pointed to “systemic problems” within the service that made it impossible to continue working for the agency.Among those problems is their classification as forestry technicians, instead of being fully recognized for their firefighting work.“You’re a firefighter if you’re thinking about applying, a forestry technician while you’re fighting fires, and if you die you’re a firefighter again?” West wrote in the letter. ""I didn’t want to risk my children growing up without a dad because I died fighting fire for an agency that didn’t even consider me a firefighter.""Communication breakdowns and department mismanagement have persisted for over a generation — and it’s frustrating the dwindling ranks of seasonal firefighters, as retirements are outpacing hiring. This is especially problematic at a time when wildland fires continue to burn larger, faster and stronger than ever before.In April, 11 U.S. senators sent a letter to U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen warning that the confluence of Covid-19 and high levels of drought in many Western states could make for volatile firefighting conditions, including a 6 percent ""'cumulative mortality rate' at large fire camps.""The warning was not passed down to those on the front lines. Instead, it was circulated among crews after someone found it on Reddit.“I am more than happy to put my life in danger for the work that I do but it felt like a stab in the back,” a current wildland firefighter, who asked to remain anonymous, said.When asked about the breakdown in communication between USFS and its employees, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who signed the letter, said, “I’m not just angry about that. I’m furious.”“We’re going to get through this fire season, but we’re not going through another fire season where there is this kind of fragmented, poorly coordinated policy that our very own firefighters aren’t even getting adequate information from Washington, D.C.,” he said. “It’s unacceptable.”The seasonality of the work, coupled with the low wages and risk, has made recruitment more difficult over the last two decades — and the government has done little to fix the problem.In 1999, the Government Accountability Office told a House subcommittee it had found that the “firefighting workforces” of both the USFS and the Bureau of Land Management “are shrinking” as a result of retirement.Over a decade later, the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, the department’s internal watchdog, reached a similar conclusion, warning of a wave of retirement without a corresponding increase in new hires.In addition to the firefighter recruitment concerns, there’s also a budgetary shortfall for the agency to perform adequate year-round forest management work aimed at reducing wildfire risk.In 2015, in a USFS paper, the agency warned that absent new large-scale funding, it had been forced to reallocate its budget toward firefighting and away from other priorities, concluding that the agency was now “at a tipping point.”“As more and more of the agency’s resources are spent each year to provide the firefighters, aircraft, and other assets necessary to protect lives, property, and natural resources from catastrophic wildfires, fewer and fewer funds and resources are available to support other agency work—including the very programs and restoration projects that reduce the fire threat,” the paper stated.Mike Rogers, a former Angeles National Forest supervisor and board member of the National Association of Forest Service Retirees, said forest management was originally the cornerstone of the agency’s work.“Our workforce was never a fire department,” he said, underscoring that he began at the agency in 1957. “In the old days, everyone put out the fire when we had a fire but then we went back to our jobs and that was managing the forest. We didn’t have specialized firefighters.”Download the NBC News app for breaking newsDespite these stark warnings, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, there has been little has been little substantial progress on increasing the Forest Service’s budget, nor has there been substantive movement on reclassification of forestry technicians as firefighters, expanding fuel reduction and other preventative efforts.However, in a rare moment of bipartisanship, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., collaborated with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on the Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety Act of 2020, which aims to reduce fire risk in their respective states.In a recent letter to Senate leadership, the two senators had a dire warning.“If we don’t take strong action now, we worry that what’s happening to California and Montana will soon become the new normal in every state in the West,” they wrote.Cyrus Farivar is a reporter on the tech investigations unit of NBC News in San Francisco.Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

Two firefighters were critically injured in the fight to contain the inferno in and around the community of Irvine.Over 75,000 people were under evacuation orders due to the Silverado Fire as of Tuesday morning, the Orange County Fire authority announced.Southern California Edison sent a letter late Monday to the California Public Utilities Commission acknowledging its electrical facilities are in the area where the Silverado fire broke out. But it said there was “no indication of any circuit activity prior to the report time of the fire” or downed conductors.""However, it appears that a lashing wire that was attached to an underbuilt telecommunication line ... may have resulted in the ignition of the fire,” the letter said.The Silverado Fire was only 5 percent contained as of Tuesday afternoon.Powerful winds in and around the area, southeast of Los Angeles, have not only helped the flames grow exponentially but also prevented aircrafts from dropping retardant and water on the fire, Orange County Fire Authority Chief Brian Fennessy said Monday.Five firefighters have been injured in the battle against the Orange County blazes, Fennessy told reporters on Tuesday. Three sustained minor injuries and were treated and released.But two other firefighters, ages 26 and 31, remain in critical condition after being intubated on Monday. Fennessy said he personally hired both firefighters within the past year and has met with their parents since their injury.""It's tough for any firefighter, certainly any fire chief, to feel this helpless when you've got part of our fire family fighting for their lives,"" Fennessy said. ""I'm confident that they're going to do all they can to fight through this. This is just who they are.""Officials said Monday that the men suffered second- and third-degree burns across 65 percent and 50 percent of their bodies.Gusts in Orange County were recorded at 88 mph, California Gov. Gavon Newsom said Tuesday, but authorities are hopeful that waning winds will help bring in the needed air support as firefighters battle on the ground.“Broadly, we will experience a reduction in the winds between now and Thursday, but the most extreme wind events we believe will present themselves later today in the evening,” Newsom said. “And most, hopefully, are behind us.”The governor said that Southern California will be under a red flag warning until at least 11 p.m. Tuesday night as the wind and dry weather conditions continue to put the state at risk. There have been 42 initial fire starts within the last 24 hours, Newsom said.“Meaning 42 wildfires had ignited in the last 24 hours,” Newsom said Tuesday. “It’s an extraordinary testament to (state firefighters) that you don’t know about most of those — they’ve suppressed the vast majority of those.”Orange County is also battling the Blue Ridge Fire, another blaze that started Monday and has grown to approximately 15,200 acres with 0 percent containment with 10 homes damaged. The wildfire has affected 2,500 houses and 10,000 people in Yorba Linda under evacuation orders, the Orange County Fire Authority announced on Tuesday.Yorba Linda is a suburb located about 37 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles and home to the The Richard Nixon Library & Museum. The former president was born and buried in Yorba Linda.Orange County officials are transitioning management of both fires to the state officials with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. More than 1,800 firefighters and 14 helicopters are being utilized across the county to fight both the Blue Ridge and Silverado Fires, Fennessy said Tuesday, as additional resources have been given to the county.Assuming the conditions continue to settle in the Irvine area, authorities expect to repopulate the ""majority"" of residents who have been evacuated since Monday.Doha Madani is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.

Damage assessments are ongoing.Emergency responders helping with evacuation efforts were met with a fire front that forced many from the area, the sheriff said, and they returned several times to continue evacuation efforts.The couple spoke with their son Wednesday evening and were adamant about staying, the family said in a statement read by the sheriff. The couple considered the property ""heaven on earth.""The East Troublesome Fire, which began Oct. 14 north of Hot Sulphur Springs, was at 188,079 acres Friday and 4 percent contained, fire officials said.It is one of several large wildfires that have burned or are still burning in Colorado this year, which include three of the largest in recorded state history.The Cameron Peak Fire, burning west of Fort Collins, is the largest and has burned 206,977 acres and was 60 percent contained Friday, according to the interagency InciWeb fire information website.

A recent Los Angeles Times headline declaring 2020 to be “The worst fire season. Again” illustrated some of the frustration residents feel over the state’s fire strategy.For decades, federal, state and local agencies have prioritized fire suppression over prevention, pouring billions of dollars into hiring and training firefighters, buying and maintaining firefighting equipment and educating the public on fire safety.But as climate change continues to fuel dry conditions in the American West, many experts say it’s long past time to shift the focus back to managing healthy forests that can better withstand fire and add to a more sustainable future.“Fires have always been part of our ecosystem,” said Mike Rogers, a former Angeles National Forest supervisor and board member of the National Association of Forest Service Retirees. “Forest management is a lot like gardening. You have to keep the forest open and thin.”Federal forest management dates back to the 1870s, when Congress created an office within the U.S. Department of Agriculture tasked with assessing the quality and conditions of forests. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt oversaw the birth of the U.S. Forest Service, which manages 193 million acres of public land across the country.In California, forest management also falls under the purview of the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.Since 2011, Cal Fire has spent more than $600 million on fire prevention efforts and removed or felled nearly 2 million dead trees. In 2018, California set the goal of treating — which can include slashing, burning, sawing or thinning trees — 500,000 acres of wildland per year, yet Cal Fire remains far from meeting that target.“It’s an ongoing process,” said Cal Fire spokeswoman Christine McMorrow. “There is always going to be more work.”Cal Fire is steadily receiving injections of money to do what it can to reduce wildfire risk, including better land management and training a new generation of foresters. In 2018, former Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that will allocate $1 billion over five years to Cal Fire to be used on fire prevention measures. But experts warn that more money is needed.“Is it enough? Well, it’s enough for what we’re doing right now, but is that enough to get all the work that needs to be done in one year or five years or 10 years? It’s going to a take lot,” McMorrow said.Long before the country’s founding, Spanish explorers documented wildland fires in California. In 1542, conquistador Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo sailed along the coast and noticed smoke billowing up from what is now known as the Los Angeles Basin. He called it “la baya de los fumos,” or “the bay of smoke.”Studies by archaeologists and historians support a theory that Cabrillo might have been witnessing an early form of land management, including the burning of shrubs and chaparral to clear dry brush and promote better conditions for hunting big game.Prescribed and controlled burns were integral to the American landscape for generations. In 1910, focus started to shift away from forest management and steer toward fire suppression after “The Big Burn” ravaged 3 million acres across Washington, Idaho and Montana, killing at least 85 people and reshaping U.S. fire policy for years to come.The U.S. Forest Service ordered that all wildland fires be extinguished as soon as possible, eventually settling on the so-called 10 a.m. policy, which emphasized suppressing fires by the morning after they started.The state’s policy to stop fires as soon as they ignite resulted in a backlog of trees in forests now choked with brush and other dry fuels. According to the U.S. Forest Service, one researcher studying the Stanislaus National Forest in Northern California found records from 1911 showing just 19 trees per acre in one section of the forest. More than a century later, the researcher and his team counted 260 trees per acre.With denser tree cover comes the danger of bigger fires, Rogers said.“We have more large trees per acre than we’ve ever had because they have continued to grow, and underneath these large trees are young shrubs that fuel fires in the crown of the trees,” he said. “When a fire starts in there, it’s unstoppable.”Drought, climate change and bark-beetle infestations have all contributed to the backlog of trees, leaving some experts to push for creative solutions to managing California’s crowded forests.One potential solution could be turning dead and diseased trees into biomass energy before they start massive wildfires.Jonathan Kusel founded the nonprofit research organization Sierra Institute for Community and Environment in 1993 in an effort to better understand how state and federal agencies could put leftover organic material to use. The institute is now working with federal and state partners on ways to supply wood chips made from low-value vegetation to biomass facilities that can then burn the organic matter to produce heat and electricity.Kusel estimates the process, when done correctly in confined barrels, is exponentially cleaner than relying on natural gas for energy. It also facilitates what Kusel calls “the appropriate thinning of forests,” or the clearing of smaller growth, to not only lower the risk of wildfires, but also to contribute to cleaner waterways and lower carbon emissions by promoting healthier forests.“We aren’t going to be successful if all we do is try to stop fire,” he said. “But we can make it less damaging ... and we can try to introduce smaller fires that can maintain habitats in a healthy state.”But finding buyers for biomass remains a big question for the Sierra Institute. Biomass is considered a dirty word among environmentalists who warn that burning plant material and releasing it into the air can increase carbon emissions.Removing small growth from forests is also more expensive and not as economically attractive as focusing on large-growth removal that can be turned into timber, Kusel acknowledged. Still, as wildfires threaten to become bigger and more dangerous, Kusel is hopeful that a new locally based biomass market could offset the cost of thinning out the state’s forests by creating smaller, better-maintained facilities that do not release dangerous pollutants into the air.“Societally we have to think differently about our forests, but we have to invest and manage them differently, too,” he said. “We have to do better.”Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

The blaze west of Fort Collins thrived as gusty winds blew in ahead of a cold front.The fire has been burning so deep into fall that it snowed more than once, halting progress temporarily but ultimately having little longterm impact, said Cass Cairns, a multi-agency spokeswoman for the incident.""It dries out really quickly,"" she said.The new evacuations were announced Saturday by the city of Loveland. The evacuation map appears to cover more than 100 square miles. Larimer County Sheriff's Office spokesman Jered Kramer said Saturday that evacuation notices have been sent to 3,000 recipients in the last 24 hours.A Saturday report from the National Interagency Coordination Center said, ""Several communities threatened.""Investigators have not determined what caused the fire, which started Aug. 13.d This week's wind event was the fourth since mid-August, each occurring before a cold front that brought little relief, Cairns said.Experts have said this year's record fires in the West correlate to climate change.The fire season in Colorado usually ends in September, Cairns said. Ski resorts often start opening in October, but this year some will contend with the Cameron Peak Fire.A spokesman for Loveland Ski Area didn't immediately respond to a request for information. The resort said in a press release Monday that it had received nearly 6 inches of snow Oct. 11 and was producing manmade powder. Last year it opened on Oct. 25, but no opening date has been set yet for 2020.The National Weather Service forecast a high temperature near 70 Saturday for Loveland. The agency warned of ""hazardous weather"" caused by winds up to 50 mph. Rain and snow were possible Sunday night before warm temperatures were expected to return.The high winds kept water- and retardant-dropping aircraft grounded Saturday, she said.The Cameron Peak Fire comes during a devastating year for wildfires in the West, including the August Complex Fire in California, that state's largest ever.The National Interagency Coordination Center said Saturday there are 29 large, ""uncontained"" wildfires burning in the United States.

Gavin Newsom wrote a letter to President Donald Trump last month requesting emergency funds, and a regional administrator with the Federal Emergency Management Agency asked the White House to declare ""a major disaster"" in seven counties ravaged by fires in September.Newsom tweeted Friday that he appealed to Trump during a phone call, and the president approved the disaster declaration after his administration initially rejected it.""Grateful for his quick response,"" the governor said.Brian Ferguson, spokesman for the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, told the Los Angeles Times that the state did not ask for a specific dollar amount because it is still assessing the damage, but he said such aid could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.""The true cost won’t be known for months or years afterward,” he said.California has had a record wildfire year, with over 8,500 blazes, more than 4.1 million acres burned, 31 lives lost and over 9,200 structures destroyed.In his letter, Newsom thanked the president for visiting California last month and for aid the state received for fires that occurred in August. But the governor wrote that the state is ""experiencing another siege of fires from early September, which continue to devastate communities throughout the state.""The blazes caused so much devastation that recovery efforts are ""beyond the state's capabilities,"" he wrote.FEMA's press secretary, Lizzie Litzow, said in a statement Friday before Trump reversed the decision that the agency determined ""the early September fires were not of such severity and magnitude to exceed the combined capabilities of the state, affected local governments, voluntary agencies and other responding federal agencies.""Much of Northern California remains under red-flag warnings as fires continue to burn.The largest and most destructive blazes this year have occurred since mid-August, with the August Complex fire quickly becoming the biggest in state history. The blaze, which was sparked by a lightning strike, has burned over a million acres and is 77 percent contained, according to Cal Fire.Officials and experts attribute the state's increasingly intense wildfire seasons to climate change and a buildup of dead and dried-out vegetation.

While it will be breezy the rest of the week, high gusts are not expected.""The conditions will remain challenging, just not nearly as serious as they were today,"" she said in a community meeting update that was broadcast online.Some mandatory evacuations have been ordered, and mandatory evacuation zones for the first time extended to the foothills just west of Fort Collins, but the city was not considered at-risk, The Associated Press reported.Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said that he understands the difficulties of people being forced to leave their homes.""We hate to do that to you, however, there's nothing worse than the concern of losing life,"" Smith said. ""And the way these winds were changing today — the ability of this thing to go any direction — that's what was tough.""Smith said some structures were destroyed by fire Wednesday, but officials won't know what those were for some time because the area remains dangerous with downed power lines and trees.

95,California braces for renewed fire threat from windy weather,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-braces-renewed-fire-threat-windy-weather-n1243304,Wed Oct 14 2020 11:24:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"SAN FRANCISCO — Dry, windy weather posed an extreme wildfire risk Wednesday in Northern California, where massive blazes already have cost hundreds of homes and killed or injured dozens of people.The National Weather Service issued a red-flag warning from 5 a.m. through Friday morning. With bone-dry humidity and wind gusts possibly hitting 55 mph, Pacific Gas & Electric warned that it may begin cutting power Wednesday evening to as many as 54,000 customers in 24 counties.The nation's largest utility was expected to make a decision earlier Wednesday on whether to implement the preemptive electricity cuts in an effort to prevent fires from being started by damaged power lines fouled or knocked down in high winds.“We really view it as a last resort option,” said Mark Quinlan, the company’s incident commander.The utility also has deployed generators and other measures to keep electricity flowing in some areas that might otherwise have lost power during the outages, Quinlan said.About 33,000 homes and businesses could begin losing power at 6 p.m., mainly in the Sierra Nevada foothills and northern San Francisco Bay Area, followed by 21,000 other customers two hours later in other portions of the Sierras and the Bay Area, along with portions of the Central Coast, PG&E said.The figures for affected customers range from more than 11,300 in Butte County, 6,000 in Santa Cruz County and around 5,400 customers in Alameda County to just 10 in Yolo County, according to the utility.About 200 people in Humboldt County in the far north could lose power Thursday afternoon as winds hit there, PG&E said.All power should be restored by late Friday night, the utility said.The outages would include regions already hit by massive wildfires. The Glass Fire that ravaged the wine country of Napa and Sonoma counties was nearly surrounded after destroying more than 1,500 homes and other buildings.PG&E said it could cut power to more than 9,200 customers in Napa and around 1,800 in Sonoma.Farther north, the Zogg Fire in Shasta and Tehama counties was 99% contained. Four people died in that blaze. PG&E estimated its cuts potentially could affect nearly 4,700 customers in Shasta and around 1,200 in Tehama.More than 8,500 wildfires have burned well over 6,406 square miles in California since the start of the year, but mostly since mid-August. Thirty-one people have died, and more than 9,200 structures have been destroyed.Most of the huge fires have been fully or substantially contained over the past eight weeks. But 11,500 firefighters remain on the lines.Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.PG&E said last month that it is executing smarter and shorter power shutoffs after receiving widespread criticism last year when it turned off electricity to 2 million people to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.PG&E’s aging equipment has previously sparked some of the state’s largest wildfires, including the deadly 2018 fire that destroyed much of the town of Paradise and killed 85. The utility pleaded guilty in June to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter; one death was ruled a suicide. The utility paid $25.5 billion in settlements to cover the losses from power line-sparked catastrophes.Meanwhile, wildfires will remain a threat in California indefinitely.“We have had a historic fire season this year,” PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel said. “We are and will continue to be in the peak of fire season until the rain and snow returns. And all of us here hope that it returns sooner rather than later.”"

Will 2020 do the same?,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/big-burn-1910-transformed-wildland-firefighting-will-2020-do-same-n1242671,Sun Oct 11 2020 10:04:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"ALAMEDA, Calif. — As California's record wildfires approached 4 million acres earlier this month, the state's top fire official compared the serial conflagrations to a pivotal event in American history — ""The Big Burn"" of 1910.The century-old blaze, which tore through millions of acres in the West, transformed American wildland firefighting into the profession it is today: a force that responds to blazes with mass mobilizations of air tankers, bulldozers and ""troops,"" as the firefighters are often called.The official, Thom Porter, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, suggested that 2020 could mark another turning point.""The science that was developed to do all those things at that point in time and carried forward 100 years — it didn't do the right thing,"" he said. ""It didn't do the thing we needed it to do right now.""""Every acre of California can and will burn someday,"" he added. ""We need to embrace that and become resilient to it.""Wildland fire experts have been pushing California to change some of those practices for years, but in interviews, they were skeptical that the massive fires and the smoke-choked skies of 2020 will prove to be as pivotal as 1910.""Maybe this historic event along the whole West Coast will make us hit the reset button,"" said Timothy Ingalsbee, a former wildland firefighter-turned-fire ecologist who is executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology. ""Instead of throwing more blood and treasure at this endless, escalating and unwinnable war on wildfire, we shift the paradigm and stake out a new relationship with fire on the land.""""Coming from Cal Fire,"" he added, ""I'll believe it when I see it.""The series of fires that exploded across parts of British Columbia, eastern Washington, Idaho and Montana in August 1910 scorched 3.25 million acres over two days. Eighty-five people died, 78 of them firefighters.Before 1910, wildfires were treated as a community issue. Most of the time, they were ignored or welcomed as a way to clear land for farming and herding, said Stephen Pyne, a professor emeritus of environmental history at Arizona State University and author of ""Year of the Fires: The Story of the Great Fires of 1910.""When a wildfire did tear through a community — some of them killed hundreds of people — the response was almost entirely community-driven, Pyne said. They ""had to fend for themselves,"" he said.The fire of 1910 changed that. It wasn't the biggest or the deadliest wildfire in the United States at that point. But a young federal agency, the U.S. Forest Service, had seen its political fortunes rise just five years before when it took control of the country's vast forestlands, Pyne said, and the fire traumatized the agency. It responded with a set of practices that reflected the progressive, conservation-minded politics of the day, he said.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and alertsThe new philosophy was crystallized in an essay written by the Harvard University philosopher and psychologist William James, who had become alarmed at the U.S.'s escalating militarism.""He wanted to redirect that enthusiasm"" toward ""a common foe — the forces of nature,"" Pyne said.What followed was the large-scale hiring of firefighters, emergency funding to pay for them and state and federal cooperation to build out the infrastructure to fight fires. Even the symbol of wildland firefighting — a combination ax and hoe known as the Pulaski Tool — was invented by a 1910 veteran, Edward Pulaski, Pyne said.Another consequential practice of the era — the ""10 a.m. rule"" — also came from a 1910 veteran. The policy, which lasted for a few dozen fires, according to Pyne, required Forest Service firefighters to extinguish a blaze by 10 o'clock the morning after it ignited.The policies amounted to an ""imperial model,"" Ingalsbee said. Instead of using fire as generations of indigenous Californians before them had — and targeting vegetation that most rapidly spread it, like dead needles and tree limbs — newly emboldened forestry officials sought ""state-dominated control over the environment,"" he said.In a memo published in August by the Forest Service and the state of California, the results of that strategy of ""wholesale fire suppression"" are described as having deprived California's wildlands of a ""preferred management tool"" — low-intensity fire.That helped create the overly dense landscape that dominates the state today, one that gave rise to powerful, seemingly unstoppable ""megafires,"" which burn over 100,000 acres. This year, the state has recorded its first million-acre wildfire in modern history, the August Complex, which has been burning across seven counties in Northern California since mid-August.""Compounding risks have made it nearly impossible for nature to self-correct,"" the memo says. ""A cycle of catastrophic wildfires, longer fire seasons, severe drought, intense wind, tree mortality, invasive species, and human population pressure threaten to convert conifer forests to shrublands and shrublands to invasive grasses.""Gov. Gavin Newsom has described the memo — which includes a joint agreement on catastrophic wildfire prevention — as a ""significant milestone"" in the effort to prevent such fires: It calls for a million acres a year in vegetation ""treatments,"" like controlled, low-intensity burns, forest thinning and timber harvesting, beginning in 2025. He has also pointed to a separate initiative completed this year that would help protect 200 vulnerable communities from out-of-control fires.The initiative, prompted by an emergency proclamation after a series of lethal blazes — including the deadliest in state history, the 2018 Camp Fire — totaled 90,000 acres.Even though that is three times the acreage Cal Fire typically averages in annual controlled fires, Ingalsbee called it ""hobby burning."" He pointed out that a couple of hundred years ago, before white settlers killed most of the state's indigenous population and miners transformed the landscape, at least 4 million acres would burn annually.Ingalsbee said Porter's comments and the language in the joint agreement were steps in the right direction. But he was skeptical that Cal Fire wasn't still a ""20th century fire suppression machine in the face of a 21st century climate crisis.""Instead of focusing on fires that threaten communities, Ingalsbee said the agency seems to attack every fire, regardless of where it is. He said that in one section of the August Complex fire, for instance, Cal Fire deployed nearly two dozen bulldozers and 10 masticators, or machines that chew through brush and small trees. The blaze would have burned into unpopulated wildlands, and ""it would have done a lot of good,"" he said.""It would have been a fuel treatment,"" he said. ""But they just threw everything at it to stop the fire from going into the wilderness, which is mind-blowing.""In an interview, Porter acknowledged that suppression has long been one of Cal Fire's primary missions. So has protecting the private landowners who own 40 percent of California's forestland. (The state owns 3 percent; the rest is owned by the federal government.)""When wildfires start, there are landowners that are going to be affected by that fire,"" Porter said. ""We don't have the luxury of contacting them and negotiating with them. Do they want it put out? The mission is put it out.""That was the case with the nearly two dozen bulldozers used in the August Complex, he said. The agency dispatched all that heavy machinery because the land the fire would have burned through before it reached the wilderness was owned by a timber company. And the timber company's owner believed the fire would have destroyed much of his business.""We were working on behalf of our constituents, a citizen of California who didn't want fire in his forest,"" Porter said.In general, that is what happens, Porter said: Private landowners don't want fire on their land. For those who do, Cal Fire will work with them to ignite ""good, healthy fire"" — a practice that will expand next year with a new program to train and certify ""burn bosses,"" as private wildfire practitioners are known.Still, that most of the state's private landowners don't want fire on their land points to a deeper philosophical problem — a problem that will likely determine whether 2020 is like 1910: How do you convince a large segment of a state in which all-out suppression has been the norm for decades that it's at an inflection point?Pyne, the environmental historian, wasn't convinced that anything will change. The pandemic, the political scene, hurricanes — there are too many distractions, he said. Besides, many thought something significant would happen after 2017, when the deadly Tubbs Fire scorched wine country, he said. The year after that, the Camp Fire exploded across Butte County.Pyne said that almost immediately after the fire of 1910, the event had been crystallized with a dramatic name — ""the Big Blowup or the Big Burn.""""We don't even have a name for these yet,"" he said. ""We don't have the engagement we need yet.""Max Moritz, a cooperative extension wildfire specialist at the University of California, Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, said that following ""Black Saturday,"" a deadly bushfire that raged across Australia in 2009, a yearlong inquiry yielded sweeping changes in everything from land use to evacuations and urban planning.""They went through an enlightenment,"" he said. ""We could hope something like that happens here, where we go beyond talking about fire as a problem of fuels and management.""Porter, meanwhile, is convinced that 2020 will turn out to be a watershed moment. He isn't sure how exactly it will play out, he said, because at the moment he and his firefighters are just trying to get through a season that could drag on for several more weeks.But looking decades out, he said, he hopes to see a California that can live with wildfire — a state where wind-driven flames don't destroy communities and tear through office tower-size trees.""It's a fire that can pass through like the rising and falling of the tide, and everything is left on the landscape unscathed,"" he said.Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."
98,California exceeds 4 million acres burned by wildfires in 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-exceeds-4-million-acres-burned-wildfires-2020-n1242078,Sun Oct 04 2020 21:53:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"ALAMEDA, Calif. — California marked a grim milestone Sunday as the number of acres burned during a record wildfire year surpassed 4 million, officials said.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, didn't provide an exact amount of land that had been scorched this year, but it said in a daily statewide summary that more than 8,200 fires have burned ""well over"" 4 million acres.Annual statistics from the department dating to 1987 show that 2020 has more than doubled the previous record.As many as 20,000 firefighters, some coming from as far away as Israel, have responded to scores of major fires across the state this year. Thirty-one people have died.The largest, most destructive blazes have occurred since mid-August, when thousands of lightning strikes sparked dozens of fires in Northern California, including the largest wildfire in state history, the nearly 1 million-acre August Complex fire, which is burning across six counties.Cal Fire said Sunday that the fire has killed one person and destroyed 159 structures. It was 51 percent contained.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and alertsNorth of the San Francisco Bay Area, thousands of firefighters continued battling a blaze that roared through wine country Sept. 27 in high temperatures and powerful winds. More than 36,000 people remained under mandatory evacuation orders in Sonoma and Napa counties Sunday, Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox said.As 12 teams continued surveying damage from the Glass Fire, the number of homes and businesses that have been destroyed rose to 564, Cox said. The teams have surveyed about 50 percent of the area, he said.Brian Newman, a fire behavior analyst with Cal Fire, said a combination of rugged terrain, parched vegetation and strong winds Saturday intensified the northern and southern sections of the fire, which grew to nearly 64,000 acres.Napa County issued new mandatory evacuation orders Sunday for an area near Mount Saint Helena, a 4,300-foot peak in Robert Louis Stevenson State Park. Images from the mountain showed a massive column of smoke rising from below.Forecasters said a high pressure ridge that has baked the region for days is expected to weaken later this week, bringing the possibility of much-needed rain.Officials and experts have attributed the state's increasingly intense wildfire seasons to climate change and a buildup of dead and dried-out vegetation across California's 33 million acres of forestland.Speaking to reporters last week, Cal Fire Director Thom Porter compared 2020 to 1910, when one of the largest wildfires ever recorded tore through parts of Washington state, Montana, Idaho and British Columbia.Porter said he expects it to take several decades to adequately prepare for increasingly intense wildfire seasons.""It's not just more firefighters,"" he said. ""It's not just more aircraft. It's not just fuel reduction project work. It's not just defensible space or home hardening. It's absolutely every one of those things. We need very piece of the system to be raised to meet the challenge that the changing climate is giving us.""Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."

Then they got Covid-19.Luckily, Jessica and Matthew; their five children, ages 5 to 10; her parents; and his mother all survived the coronavirus, and the couple are already on the hunt for a new home. But it wasn't easy.They fled the Sept. 7 Babbs-Malden Fire and sought refuge at the home of Jessica's parents before moving on to stay with friends.""As we drove to my in-laws, my kids all excitedly got out of the minivan to go in to see Grandma,"" Matthew, 36, said Saturday. ""And Jessica informed me that everything was gone.""Then, in a matter of days, the Grahams contracted the coronavirus.""My dad became sick with flu-like symptoms,"" said Jessica, 38. ""So we think there's a very good chance that we caught it from him, though he was never tested.""Smoke-filled air from late-summer fires across Washington muddled the couple's thoughts about their symptoms, they said.""We started having some sinus issues, coughing, but we thought it's hazardous air and didn't really think too much of it,"" Jessica said.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakOn Sept. 16, she informed Matthew that his mother had contracted the virus, just a few days after she took care of their children. They believe his mother got it from the family. The Grahams got tested.""The nurse asked me if there was a whole group of us with the same last names that had been tested,"" he said. ""And I told her, 'Yeah, there are.' And she said: 'Yeah, they're all positive. Everybody has it.'""The children appeared to get through Covid-19 fairly quickly, the couple said. But Matthew seemed to get the worst of it, spending a week in bed at a hotel room the family used for isolation.""People don't adequately describe how miserable coronaviruses are in general,"" he said. ""Curled up in the fetal position, not moving, that really isn't a good state to be in.""The bad news kept coming.After the fire but before they tested positive, the Grahams stayed briefly with friends, who also came down with the virus. On Thursday, the couple dropped off food for the family, which includes a 14-year-old.""They did look really miserable,"" Jessica said. ""We're just praying that they'll all be OK.""The moral of this chapter for the Grahams is that people should get tested for the virus at the slightest sign of symptoms, the couple said.""My dad was skeptical of the test, because of all that information going around,"" Jessica said. ""And if he had just gone and got tested and was positive, we would have known right away to go into quarantine.""I would just really urge people to get tested,"" she said.Janhvi Bhojwani is an associate reporter with NBC News' Social Newsgathering team.

He is being cared for at the Oakland Zoo.In a Facebook post on Friday, the zoo said it had named the cub Captain Cal after the mascot for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. He is being treated for burns on his feet.""He's been eating & looks much better than he did when he arrived,"" the zoo said.The cub was found Wednesday in an area scorched by the Zogg Fire near Redding, about 160 miles north of Sacramento.The zoo said in a press release that after the firefighter found the cub alone, it was turned over to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which asked the zoo for its help in treating the cub.“We are so grateful for the Oakland Zoo’s expertise, world-class facilities and willingness to step up – on extremely short notice – to help wildlife in need,” the agency's senior wildlife veterinarian, Dr. Deana Clifford, said in a statement.“Unfortunately, a lion this size is too small to be released back into the wild, but we are hopeful that under the Zoo’s care, it will get a second chance as an ambassador for its species,"" the statement said.The cub suffered ""severe"" burns on his paws and his whiskers are completely singed off, Oakland Zoo said. X-rays showed that there is no damage to his lungs or bones.The zoo said in its press release that Captain Cal is eating on his own and ""acting feisty,"" which it said are signs of improvement.“We’re grateful to be part of this amazing little cub’s rescue and rehabilitation,"" said the zoo's veterinary hospital director, Dr. Alex Herman, in a statement. ""We’re cautiously optimistic that this cub will now survive and thrive, our dedicated team at Oakland Zoo is fully committed to do everything we can for him and for his beautiful species.”Mountain lion cubs stay with their mothers until they are about two years old in order to learn how to survive in the wild, according to the zoo. Because Captain Cal was orphaned at such a young age, he will be moved to a ""suitable forever home"" after he leaves the zoo's hospital, the press release stated.The Zogg Fire has burned more than 56,300 acres and destroyed 179 structures since it started Sunday in Shasta County. Four people have been killed in the fire that is 57 percent contained.Minyvonne Burke is a breaking news reporter for NBC News."

""You’re waiting for that phone call, but you're not wanting that phone call.""When he finally spoke with his mother, she had good news — his dad had been fighting a different fire, the Bobcat Fire in the Angeles National Forest, and was safe. The fatality occurred east of Los Angeles in the San Bernardino National Forest during the El Dorado Fire.""We try to go about our lives, but it's always in the back of our minds that something could happen,"" Carrillo Jr. said.Heriberto Carrillo Sr. is one of the thousands of U.S. Forest Service firefighters who have fanned out across the West Coast to fight blazes in California, Oregon and Washington during yet another record-setting fire season.In California, more than 3.7 million acres of wilderness have been destroyed and nearly 30 lives lost this year alone, according to Cal Fire data. As of Thursday, firefighters were struggling to combat more than 8,100 fires across the state.Fire season is not new to the American West but the length and ferocity of the season worsens every year. Cal Fire estimates that fire season has increased by 75 days across the Sierras and corresponds to an increase in intensity of forest fires in California.Federal wildland crews are sometimes the last line of defense and are often called in after local resources are depleted. They crisscross states throughout the fire season and are typically considered seasonal employees who are paid to work from May through October.Whenever a firefighter dies, even if it's in another state, Carrillo and his crew observe a moment of silence.""When we’re all together, it’s like we’re family,"" Carrillo said.At 68, Carrillo stands apart from many of his colleagues. He has more than 40 years experience and has no intention of retiring any time soon. He is 10 years older than the next senior crew member, Carrillo said.""I thank God I still have the energy,"" he added. ""I like working outside in the mountains and using a chainsaw.""Carrillo became a wildland firefighter in 1976, just two years after immigrating to the United States from his native Mexico. He was in his early 20s at the time and a friend encouraged him to apply for a job as a firefighter.Carrillo immediately liked the work but was forced to find another job because of the seasonal nature of the industry. He became a fieldworker, picking fruit in the farms of Central California that feed much of the nation. When he isn't fighting fires, Carrillo is tending to orange, apple, cherry and olive trees.""That’s what most Mexican men do,"" Carrillo Jr. said of his father. ""They're going to work until the day they die.""Despite his usual calm under pressure, Carrillo recently found himself in the middle of the worst fire fight he has faced in 43 years on the job.It was one day before he was scheduled to return home to Central California. He had already spent 13 days in the Angeles National Forest above Los Angeles fighting a stubborn wildfire that threatened to consume the historical Mount Wilson Observatory and its priceless telescopes.Earlier in the day, Carrillo had carried three fire hoses to a controlled burn near the observatory in an effort to prevent the larger Bobcat Fire from destroying the famed campus. Suddenly the wind changed direction and Carrillo and nearly 20 other firefighters were encircled by flames.""He said it was the toughest fight of his life,"" Carrillo Jr. said. ""He never had to work so hard to survive.""When asked about the incident, Carrillo was unfazed.""It's like anything else,"" he said. ""I just thank God nothing worse has happened.""Even at his age, Carrillo shrugs off the danger and physical strain of being a federal firefighter. He said that he's ""used to it"" now and uses his own endurance to test and inspire some of the younger men and women who serve alongside him.He stays in shape during the off season by climbing up and down 60-foot ladders in the fruit fields. When he's picking oranges, he carries 80 pounds of them at a time, he said.""He likes to tell his guys that some of them weren't even born yet when he first started,"" Carrillo's daughter, Lillian Alonso, said. ""Whenever he sees someone not doing their job well, he will go out and show him.""Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

At least 31 wildfire-related deaths have been recorded in 2020.Cal Fire communications Chief Scott McLean said the 4 million mark could be reached in the next few days. Alaska's 2004 season saw 6.6 million acres burn. ""In recorded history, this is the worst season in California,"" he said.Midsummer's August Complex Fire, in seven Northern California counties, ""has almost reached 1 million acres and is only 51 percent contained,"" said Cal Fire spokesperson Sean McFadden.The blaze on federal land is the largest wildfire in state history.Much focus this week has been on the Glass Fire in the California wine country of Napa and Sonoma counties. It started Sunday and burned through vineyards, resorts and homes, Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox said. It was at 60,148 acres with 6 percent containment Friday.Santa Rosa police Chief Ray Navarro said at a news conference Friday that 12,925 people were under orders to evacuate as a result of the blaze; another 22,631 were covered by evacuation warnings. Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said more evacuations were possible through Saturday.A few hours later, Cal Fire announced that evacuation orders in Sonoma County were downgraded to evacuation warnings.The Glass Fire so far has destroyed 558 structures and damaged 108, said Cal Fire unit Chief Shana Jones.Jeff Lyles, 33, of St. Helena said he fled the area Sunday night and did not know what became of his home until driving back Tuesday.""Well, moment of truth, and pulled in, and said, 'Nope, it's gone,'"" he said. ""The mailbox was still there.""A red flag fire weather warning was in effect for the fire zone north of the Bay Area through Saturday morning. Officials fear that the weather will get worse Friday afternoon and night before improving with a cool onshore push next week.""We’re coming up on the most critical period later this afternoon and this evening,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Ryan Walbrun.Wind gusts out of the northwest could reach 35 mph, he said.A high temperature of 101 was forecast for Santa Rosa Friday. The weekend could see cooling into the 90s for high temperatures before cooler ocean air moves in next week and pushes highs into the 80s, Walbrun said.""Winds are going to get lighter,"" he said.Cal Fire incident manager Billy See said Friday that the agency ""anticipates better weather conditions.""""We are looking forward to decreased winds, decreased temperatures, increased humidities, which will give our firefighters and our boots on the ground a fighting chance to gain additional perimeter control and start to bring some normalcy back to these impacted areas,"" he said.The state was grappling with 23 major wildfires. There were fires burning Friday from San Diego County to the Oregon border.The 396,624-acre SCU Lightning Complex fire, named for Cal Fire's Santa Clara County unit, offered some good news Friday: It was 100 percent contained nearly six weeks after it started.Dennis Romero writes for NBC News and is based in Los Angeles."

He decided to go protect it himself.Elise Jones watched through a security camera Sunday night as Newnom, 34, worked to keep the fire at bay.“You could see embers flying in the wind and all over the place,” Jones said. “You’re just like, ‘yeah, those are flames. My mom was crying a lot. She was just very concerned for him.”Her two kids, parents and brother’s family saw Newnom struggle to combat raging flames and stubborn winds.For hours, Newnom fought to extinguish the fires threatening the house. Four firefighters from the Santa Rosa department joined him.“I'm going around the house and putting out embers on the roof because it's just blowing embers, and they're just bouncing off the house, bouncing off the roof, bouncing off everywhere,” Newnom said. “And there were a couple of times during the burn that I'm like, wow, OK, we might lose this thing.”The house was surrounded “360 degrees around” by flames, Jones said. But it was not damaged, to Newnom and the four other Santa Rosa firefighters.Once the house was deemed safe, the other firefighters left and Newnom was left putting out remaining flames with a garden hose. “t’s a lot slower of an operation,” Newnom joked.Jones, 35, was at her parents’ house earlier in the day when they received an evacuation text. Newnom urged her to take it seriously, so they evacuated to her brother’s house out of the line of fire.The blaze was known as the Shady Fire when it threatened the home Sunday, but it was since merged with the Glass Fire, which ignited overnight Sunday in the Napa Valley and burned through vineyards, resorts and homes. It’s grown to nearly 60,000 acres and destroyed more than 250 buildings and damaged 144 more.More than 20 fires are raging in the state.Fires have claimed 30 lives across the state since the start of the unprecedented fire season.California has seen the largest wildfire in state history and more than 3.7 million acres have burned across the state, much of it Northern California, which recorded one of its driest winters on record.Jones feels lucky that her parents’ home was spared and that she got to see the fight to save it live on the security camera.“It was very, not peaceful, but helpful to be able to watch what was going on and have answers almost immediately,” she said.Sarah Kaufman is a Los Angeles based reporter for the social newsgathering team."

The alert went into effect Thursday afternoon and is expected to remain in place through Saturday morning, with gusty northwest winds and dry, hot conditions.Twenty-four thousand buildings in Napa and Sonoma counties, north of San Francisco, remained threatened by the Glass Fire, which ignited overnight Sunday in the Napa Valley and burned through vineyards, resorts and homes, Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox told reporters.Nearly 250 buildings have been destroyed and 144 more more have been damaged, according to an incident report released Thursday night. The fire had grown to 58,880 acres.About 70,000 people were under evacuation orders, NBC Bay Area reported. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries, though two firefighters were forced to take cover in fire shelters while battling the inferno Sunday.Speaking Thursday from a burned-out elementary school in Napa County, Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters that the scene was a familiar one. Many in the region north of San Francisco have evacuated their homes multiple times since 2017, when the deadly Tubbs fire tore through Sonoma and Napa counties, killing 22 and destroying thousands of buildings.They've ""been torn asunder by wildfires seemingly every single year,"" he said, adding that the blazes are like a ""drum beat where people are exhausted, concerned and anxious about their fate and their future, not just their safety.""""Clearly, we have our work cut out for us,"" he added.He pleaded with residents to heed evacuation orders, saying that the red flag weather conditions could turn the vast majority of embers whipped up by powerful winds into likely sources of ignition.The Glass Fire was five percent contained, but officials said heavy smoke had made it difficult to use the fire fighting aircraft often relied upon to dump retardant on burning forest and brush.One fear is that the fire could make a run toward Sonoma Valley by way of a state park just east of Santa Rosa, a city of roughly 176,000, Sonoma County Supervisor Susan Gorin said Thursday.She called the possibility remote, but the fire blazed a similar path toward Santa Rosa late Sunday night, racing toward the city's Oakmont section in a matter of hours.Santa Rose Police Chief Ray Navarro said Thursday that nearly 13,000 people within the city remained under mandatory evacuation orders. Another 22,000 were under evacuation warnings.Air quality around much of the San Francisco Bay Area deteriorated as hazy, smoky conditions from the fires settled over the region. On Thursday, officials extended a hazardous air warning through Tuesday, pushing the number of ""spare the air"" alerts issued this year to 41, a record.There are over 17,000 firefighters battling more than 20 major wildfires across California. Since mid-August, when thousands of lightning strikes ignited several of the largest wildfires in state history, 3.6 million acres have burned across the state, much of it Northern California, which recorded one of its driest winters on record.The length of containment lines dug around wildfires in the state is so massive they could stretch from San Diego to New York City, Cal Fire director Thom Porter said Thursday.""It's likely that in the next day or two we'll crest the 4 million acre mark,"" he said.Some officials in the state, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, have linked this year's unprecedented wildfire season to climate change.""Climate change isn’t something to address in the distant future. The climate crisis is here,"" the governor tweeted Wednesday.Earlier this month, Newsom said that since 1980, the average temperature in the state from June to September rose from around 71 degrees to about 74.Other experts have pointed to a build-up of dried out vegetation across California's vast forestland — more than half of which is owned by the federal government — that has provided ample fuel for out-of-control megafires.The infernos have claimed the lives of 30 people this year, with the most recent death being a man who was badly burned from the Zogg Fire in Shasta County.Shasta County Sheriff Eric Magrini said Wednesday that the man was transported to a hospital but later died of his injuries.Four people, including the man, have been killed in the Zogg Fire, which has burned more than 55,000 acres and destroyed nearly 150 structures since it started Sunday. It was 26 percent contained as of Thursday afternoon.Magrini's office identified one of the victims Thursday as Karin King, 79, of Igo, a small town 130 miles south of the Oregon state line. Her body was found on Zogg Mine Road, the street that Cal Fire lists as the location of the blaze.Tim Stelloh reported from California.

They fled as trees crackled and propane tanks exploded as the blaze reached their community.""I thought we were going to burn alive. I really did. It was horrible,"" Nikki Conant said.No deaths are associated with the Glass Fire.The entire city of Calistoga, population around 5,000, was under an evacuation order as the Glass Fire was threatening the city, Cal Fire operations section chief Mark Brunton said in a video update.Firefighters are ""doing everything we can to prevent the fire from progressing towards the city of Calistoga,"" he said.In Shasta County, where around 2,000 people have been evacuated, the sheriff pleaded for patience, telling residents eager to return that some areas are still unsafe.Tuesday night, a tree in an evacuation zone fell on a sheriff's patrol car with two deputies inside, crushing the vehicle, the sheriff's office said. The deputies were not hurt. The car was totaled.Last night a Shasta County Sheriff cruiser was crushed by a falling tree in the burned area.

Authorities said the Glass Fire, which began overnight Sunday, has already destroyed 80 residences.Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick warned Tuesday that many might be experiencing “fire fatigue” as the three-year mark of the devastating Tubbs fire looms. The 2017 Tubbs fire killed 22 people, destroyed more than 5,600 structures and burned around 36,800 acres.“This is our fourth major fire in our community since 2017,” Essick said. “Many people are feeling the effects. Many people are evacuating who have evacuated multiple times.”The Glass Fire began just before 4 a.m. Sunday and merged with two other fires, quickly expanding over the famed wine country region.Authorities urged residents in the surrounding areas to remain vigilant and prepared, ready to evacuate as soon as orders to leave may come down. Residents located south of Chiles Pope Valley Road, east of Ink Grade Road, west of Pope Valley Cross Road and the entire town of Angwin have been ordered to leave as of Tuesday afternoon.Though winds have eased and allowed for some hope of containing the spread of the flames, firefighters are still working around the clock to quell the blaze. First responders have split the response into two zones, with an east zone focused on Napa County and the west zone encompassing Sonoma County.Drone footage captured the destruction surrounding Mountain Hawk Drive in Santa Rosa, about 60 miles north of downtown San Francisco, after flames from the Glass Fire roared through the neighborhood.Three people were killed in the Zogg Fire, which ignited southwest of the city of Redding, a little over 200 miles away from the Glass Fire. The Zogg Fire is also zero percent contained and has burned more than 40,317 acres, based on the latest Cal Fire data.California has seen the worst wildfire season in state history over the last few months with more than 3.7 million acres burned, 7,874 structures damaged and at least 28 killed so far, according to Cal Fire.Doha Madani is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.

But he pleaded with residents to heed evacuation orders.""This is fast-moving,"" he said. ""When you hear that order, evacuate immediately.""According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, the blaze, which ignited southwest of the city of Redding, had no containment on Monday afternoon.Five hundred structures were threatened by the blaze, a CalFire spokesman said earlier. He added that reports of damaged and destroyed buildings have not been confirmed by the department.North of the San Francisco Bay Area, in Napa and Sonoma counties, the Glass Fire rapidly scorched more than 36,000 acres and is zero percent contained, according to Cal Fire Division Chief Ben Nichols. It started early Sunday in Napa Valley and roared west overnight, merging with two other fires as it burned through vineyards and buildings.At least 8,500 structures are threatened by it, according to NBC Bay Area. No injuries or deaths have been confirmed, Nichols said, though he added that he'd heard reports of burned residents.State Sen. Bill Dodd, who represents the area, estimated that hundreds of homes, wineries and other businesses were destroyed after the blaze exploded Sunday night amid powerful winds and high temperatures.""This was pretty devastating,"" Dodd said after touring areas hit hard by the fire. ""Just literally hundreds and hundreds of homes devastated with nothing standing.""Among the well-known businesses that Dodd said burned were Calistoga Ranch, a luxury resort, and parts of Meadowood, a resort with a Michelin-starred restaurant. Also lost in the fire was the Château Boswell Winery in St. Helena, a family-owned winery founded in 1979.""It was like a nuclear bomb went off,"" Dodd said of Calistoga Ranch. ""You couldn’t see anything green anywhere. It was just utter devastation.""The blaze also made a run toward Santa Rosa, a city of nearly 175,000 in Sonoma County that lost hundreds of homes three years ago after flames jumped a highway and scorched the neighborhood of Coffey Park, fire officials said.California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday declared a state of emergency in Napa, Sonoma and Shasta counties due to the Glass and Zogg fires, which his office said in a statement ""have burned tens of thousands of acres, destroyed homes and critical infrastructure and caused the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents.""Newsom also sent a letter to President Donald Trump asking for a major disaster declarations to help in state and local wildfire response and recovery efforts in Fresno, Los Angeles, Madera, Mendocino, San Bernardino, San Diego and Siskiyou counties.Santa Rosa Fire Chief Anthony Gossner said Monday that there were ""significant losses"" in the neighborhood of Oakmont. Gossner didn't know how many buildings burned, but he said many were ranch homes.Janneke Byrne, 27, said her parents evacuated from their house in Santa Rosa to her home in another part of the city. It was the third time in as many years that they’d left their place on the city’s east side, near Annadel State Park, worried it might not be there when they returned because of a wildfire. “They’ve never really unpacked,” Byrne said Monday.This time, because of how quickly the fire had moved from Napa County toward Santa Rosa, her parents were resigned to losing their home, Byrne said.On Monday afternoon, as she and her mother reminisced about the house where they’ve lived for almost two decades, her father called from another room and told them to come watch the news. A television journalist doing a live shot was reporting from in front of their home, which was still standing.“We screamed and danced,” Byrne tweeted.Her parents are among 68,000 people who remain under evacuation orders in Sonoma County, according to sheriff's spokesman Spencer Crum.Dodd, the state senator, estimated that at least another 10,000 were under similar orders in Napa.Among those shuttled to safety were residents of the Oakmont Village retirement community in Santa Rosa, city spokeswoman Elise Howard said.About 100 residents who don't drive or have nearby loved ones to pick them up were loaded on to five city buses between midnight and 1 a.m. PT and taken to an evacuation center set up at a park 11 miles away, Howard added.In Butte County, the town of Paradise, which was devastated by California's deadliest fire on record two years ago,was put under an evacuation warning Sunday, meaning residents should prepare to leave any minute.The town is near the North Complex Fire, a series of blazes that began more than a month ago and have burned more than 300,000 acres north of Sacramento. According to CalFire, the fire is 78 percent contained.The fires that erupted over the weekend are only the latest blazes in what officials have called a historic wildfire season. Since the beginning of the year, there have been 8,100 wildfires that have burned more than 3.7 million acres in California, according to Cal Fire.The state has recorded 29 fatalities and more than 7,000 structures have been destroyed.Tim Stelloh reported from California.

The department said the fire had grown to 1,500 acres with no containment.A hospital in St. Helena, Adventist Health, suspended operations and moved all of its patients Sunday morning. In a statement, the hospital described the move as a precaution and said that patients were being transferred to other facilities while their relatives are notified.Mandatory evacuations were issued for the communities of Deer Park and Angwin on Sunday, according to the Napa County Office of Emergency Services, which ordered more evacuations in the region on Sunday afternoon.Aerial video captured by NBC Bay Area showed firefighting air craft drop retardant on flames rising from the hills below, while the Napa County Sheriff's Office published dashcam video showing a deputy plowing through the blaze to help with evacuations.""Never wait til the last second to evacuate,"" the sheriff's office said.Glass Fire: Never wait til the last second to evacuate.

Three years ago, the Tubbs Fire devastated the area, killing 22 people and destroying thousands of buildings.A couple of hours north, in Shasta County, mandatory evacuations were also ordered after the Zogg Fire ignited on Sunday afternoon. The fire was 400 acres, according to CalFire. The Shasta County Sheriff’s Office issued the evacuations in an area southwest of Redding, a city of roughly 92,000.Forecasters attributed the the heat to a strong high-pressure system parked over the West Coast, said meteorologist Kristen Stewart of the National Weather Service office in Oxnard, California.""The high pressure will keep the heat on for the week,"" she said.Higher temperatures were expected to develop in Southern California on Monday along with offshore winds that could last through at least Thursday, she said. Temperatures are likely to reach the triple digits in inland valleys, she said.A fire weather watch was in effect Monday for Los Angeles and Ventura counties.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said much of Northern California was under a red-flag fire warning of critical fire conditions for Sunday and Monday.Pacific Gas & Electric—the utility whose equipment was blamed for the state's deadliest fire—announced Saturday that it would turn off electricity for 97,000 customers in phases as a precaution starting Sunday morning.It was only two weeks ago that the largest wildfire in state history grew into a 870,200-acre behemoth on federal land north of Sacramento. The blaze, which started Aug. 16, was still burning and only 43 percent contained Saturday, according to Cal Fire.""Firefighters are getting a break, but not much,"" said Cal Fire spokesperson Christine McMorrow.

114,Wildfires taint West Coast vineyards with taste of smoke,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wildfires-taint-west-coast-vineyards-taste-smoke-n1240919,Thu Sep 24 2020 13:15:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),"TURNER, Ore. — Smoke from the West Coast wildfires has tainted grapes in some of the nation’s most celebrated wine regions with an ashy flavor that could spell disaster for the 2020 vintage.Wineries in California, Oregon and Washington have survived severe wildfires before, but the smoke from this year’s blazes has been especially bad — thick enough to obscure vineyards drooping with clusters of grapes almost ready for harvest. Day after day, some West Coast cities endured some of the worst air quality in the world.No one knows the extent of the smoke damage to the crop, and growers are trying to assess the severity. If tainted grapes are made into wine without steps to minimize the harm or weed out the damaged fruit, the result could be wine so bad that it cannot be marketed.The wildfires are likely to be “without question the single worst disaster the wine-grape growing community has ever faced,” said John Aguirre, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers.Winemakers around the world are already adapting to climate change, including rising temperatures and more frequent, more severe droughts. Those near fire-prone forests face the additional risk that smoke could ruin everything.“Unfortunately, climate experts are telling us this is going to be a problem,” said Anita Oberholster, a wine expert at the University of California, Davis. “And so we need to do better. We need to do loads more research.”With this year’s harvest underway, some wineries are not accepting grapes they had agreed to purchase unless they have been tested for smoke taint, Aguirre said. But laboratories are too backed up to analyze new orders in time.ETS Laboratories, in the Napa Valley town of St. Helena, California, says test results on grape samples received now will not be ready until November. New clients will have to wait even longer for results, according to the lab’s website.In every grape he has come across, Noah Dorrance, owner of Reeve Wines in Healdsburg, California, told the San Francisco Chronicle, “you could already taste and smell this ashy, barbecued flavor, kind of like a campfire.”Aguirre recalled sampling smoke-damaged wine during a tasting. One description on a tasting card compared the flavor to “fecal plastic.”“I tasted it and I went, ‘Oh, my God. Bingo,’” Aguirre said.The issue comes down to compounds called volatile phenols, which are released when wood burns and can be absorbed by grapes, Oberholster said.The compounds are naturally present in grapes. But when their levels get too high, they can impart the foul tastes, “and obviously that’s not a character most people want in their wine,” Oberholster said.Australian wine researchers were the first to notice the risks. In 2003, they linked smoke in the atmosphere to a taint in wine, said Mark Krstic, managing director of the Australian Wine Research Institute. From then until 2015, Australian producers lost more than $286 million ($400 million Australian) in grapes and wine revenue as a result of smoke.The problems continue. Australia’s most recent fire season was “horrific,” Krstic said.“Basically the eastern seaboard of Australia was pretty much on fire and extended across many wine regions,” he said in a phone interview.In the forested foothills bordering Oregon’s Willamette Valley, flames smothered the region, famous for its cool-climate pinot noirs, in thick yellow-brown smoke.“Pinot noir is a very thin-skinned grape, meaning it’s very delicate in nature, and you can’t mask any type of flaws in the growing condition or in the winery,” said Christine Clair, winery director of Willamette Valley Vineyards in Turner, Oregon.Jim Bernau, founder of Willamette Valley Vineyards, said of the smoke: “I’ve been here growing wine grapes for over 38 years, and I have never experienced or seen anything like this as a wine grower.”By last weekend, rain and shifting winds had cleared the skies. Bernau believed many Oregon wineries would escape damage because the smoke did not linger too long.His winery has been fermenting small samples to gauge whether smoke affects the resulting wine. In the samples for white and rosé wines, yeast is introduced into juice that was hand-squeezed from the grapes, with the skins immediately removed.“After just about two days, you can have a pretty good idea if that juice that now became wine is viable,” Clair said. The results indicated a low risk of smoke taint for the whites and rosés.In fermenting red samples, the skin is left on. Initial results are also promising, but the winery is prepared to turn some of the grapes with heavier smoke exposure into rosé instead of red wine, Clair said.The wine industry had already been hammered this year by the coronavirus and shutdown of restaurants, bars and wine tasting rooms.“I’m fully expecting a plague of locusts to descend and maybe 40 days of night,” Aguirre said. “I mean, it’s just nuts.”But the West Coast’s 2020 “wildfire vintage” — as some winemakers are already calling it — might not be so bad.In 2018, a California company abruptly canceled contracts to buy grapes worth millions of dollars from southern Oregon vineyards, claiming fears they were tainted by wildfire smoke. Four Oregon wineries stepped in, bought the grapes and produced “Oregon Solidarity” wines.They got good reviews."

It was 15 percent contained, according to the fire-reporting site InciWeb.About 4,000 people remained under evacuation orders in the region, Smith said, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office issued a slate of new evacuation warnings Monday.In a letter Friday, the chairman of Mount Wilson's board of trustees, Sam Hale, said firefighters had declared the facility safe after an ""extremely stressful week.""""It was a real nail biter right to the end,"" he said.The firefighters used ""strategic firing"" — backfires that act as barriers against advancing flames — to protect the observatory, which was founded in 1904 and is home to some of the most important astronomical discoveries of the 20th century.""We owe our very existence to the firefighters on the ground and the helicopter pilots,"" Hale said. ""They are our heroes.""Hale said staff members hadn't returned to the observatory, so it wasn't clear what structures were damaged. The facility tweeted Monday that hot spots were still burning around part of a containment line but that the observatory was safe.Angeles National Forest, where the blaze is burning, said Monday that a firefighting aircraft was briefly grounded after a drone was spotted flying in the area.The Bobcat Fire is one of 27 major fires burning around the state during what Gov. Gavin Newsom described Monday as a historic wildfire season. Nearly 8,000 fires have burned 3.6 million acres — a massive increase over the same time last year, when 157,000 acres had burned in just over 5,000 fires.Experts and officials have attributed the spike to climate change and a build-up of dry and dead vegetation in the state's forests. Five of the 10 largest wildfires in state history have ignited this year, including the giant August Complex, a series of fires that have scorched more than 846,000 acres across two remote counties in the northwestern part of the state.Twenty-six people have died this year. Fifteen were killed in the same county where the state's deadliest wildfire on record, the Paradise Fire, left 85 people dead in 2018.Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."

Mountains usually visible for miles could barely be seen up close.Fueled by triple-digit heat and dry brush untouched by flames for more than 60 years, the Bobcat Fire continues to elude firefighters two weeks after it erupted in the San Gabriel Mountains. Fire officials point to steep terrain and changing winds as two of many factors making the wildfire east of Los Angeles especially challenging.L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby recently emphasized a third challenge: Firefighting resources across the state are strained by the worst fire season in California history.“Five of the top 20 fires to ever burn in the state of California are burning right now in Northern California, which has challenged us in getting some of the resources here that we would normally get,” Osby said Friday. ""The fire behavior that we're getting in this fire and throughout the state of California is unprecedented.”The cause of the Bobcat Fire, which has charred more than 91,000 acres and was 15 percent contained Saturday, has not been determined, the U.S. Forest Service said. About 1,600 personnel are assigned to fight it, a number that would normally be above 2,000 for a fire this size, said a spokesman for the Angeles National Forest.Many area residents remain watchful as fire officials issue evacuation orders, lift them and issue new ones for neighboring areas. Checking air quality before venturing outside for a walk or jog has become a daily occurrence. People are advised to keep an emergency kit near their front doors or inside theirs car should they suddenly have to flee.On Saturday, people living in nearby desert cities were ordered to evacuate. Last week, residents on the southern boundary of the fire in the San Gabriel Valley were told to leave their homes.“It’s been a stressful week,” Monrovia resident Anna Howie told NBC News. “I don’t think I’ve gotten three or four hours of sleep each night.”Monrovia resident Michael Kunch said he has experienced many California fire seasons but “this has been the scariest.”The fire was stuck at 0 percent containment for several days but then steadily grew to 3 percent as firefighters rushed to protect the historic Mount Wilson Observatory. Founded in 1904, the observatory once hosted groundbreaking astronomers like Edwin Hubble and is home to dozens of irreplaceable telescopes.For those watching the cameras, remain calm (RC) #BobcatFire https://t.co/hlVYwVSoUe pic.twitter.com/9JaCmT9aGvContainment grew to 6 percent last week, only to fall back to 3 percent later as winds shifted and strengthened. At one point, the fire came within 500 feet of the observatory, forcing employees to evacuate and firefighters to make an aggressive stand in a national forest where elevation ranges from 1,600 feet to more than 10,000 feet.By Thursday, containment was up to 9 percent and nearly doubled to 15 percent on Friday.But as containment grew, so did the fire. It was approximately 70,000 acres Friday morning but 24 hours later had spread to more than 91,000 acres.Officials estimate that damage to structures has been minimal, but affected homeowners say they are devastated by the destruction.“I have been heartbroken over the loss,” Deb Burgess, president of the Sturtevant Camp board, said in an email.Burgess owns a cabin at the historic Sturtevant Camp, a cluster of cabins dating to 1893 that can be reached only by foot or horseback. She has not been allowed to visit the site and fears the Bobcat Fire may have destroyed it.Locals worry that 80 cabins in the neighboring Big Santa Anita Canyon were also destroyed or damaged.“These are really rare circumstances,” said Andrew Mitchell, spokesman for the Angeles National Forest. “It’s the most horrible thing in the world when you see a home burn. We’re really trying to focus on that.”Firefighters are deploying every weapon in their arsenal as the Bobcat Fire continues to rage. They are bulldozing control lines along its perimeter to try to slow it down. Planes and helicopters are dumping water and fire retardant when possible, although smoky conditions made flying impossible for several days last week.On the ground, firefighters are cleaning up “slop,” spot fires that jump control lines, and using small, controlled fires to preempt a bigger, more ferocious flank from igniting.“This is a perfect storm,” Mitchell said. “Every fire has its individual challenges and you have to adapt to those challenges.”Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

It isn't clear when Yosemite will reopen.Two wildfires were burning in or near the park, including the massive Creek Fire to the south. The 244,756-acre blaze ignited this month, trapping dozens of people at a campground in Sierra National Forest and destroying hundreds of homes and other buildings.The fire was 18 percent contained Thursday.To the south, the Bobcat Fire continued to burn across thousands of acres of national forestland in the San Gabriel Mountains, just north of Los Angeles.While firefighters have so far kept it from damaging a historic observatory in Angeles National Forest, the fire roared overnight toward Juniper Hills, an unincorporated community of about 400 homes in the San Gabriel foothills.The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department issued evacuation orders for Juniper Hills and other nearby communities Thursday afternoon.Aeronautical engineer David Borden, president of the Juniper Hills Community Association, said he saw flames a couple of miles from his home early Thursday while he was preparing to go to work in the nearby city of Palmdale.So Borden, 62, loaded his birth certificate, musical instruments, family pictures and other personal items into his car before leaving. While speaking to a reporter Thursday afternoon, he was returning to Juniper Hills to see whether his home was still there.He said he wasn't sure how far he'd get or where he'd stay if he couldn't get home.""After a certain point, what can you do?"" he said. ""It's like complaining that it's raining outside. You might as well deal with it.""A record 3.4 million acres have burned in California this year, a staggering number that officials and experts have attributed to climate change and a buildup of dried vegetation. Twenty-five people have died in the state, and 5,400 structures have burned.In Oregon, where fast-moving wildfires have scorched more than 1 million acres, destroyed more than 1,000 homes and killed eight people, Travis Cook's mother and his brother died while waiting to evacuate from her home in the Elkhorn Valley, east of Salem, he told NBC affiliate KGW of Portland.When Travis Cook spoke to his mother, Cathy Cook, 71, last week, she said she and Travis' brother, Justin Cook, 41, had packed their bags and were awaiting the order to leave, KGW reported. But Travis Cook said the order appears to have come too late — a search-and-rescue team found their bodies near her home in a neighborhood devastated by the Beachie Creek Fire.""It feels like a nightmare,"" he told KGW. ""I still cannot believe — I wake up in the mornings and it's just, like, is this really happening?""Download the NBC News app for breaking newsSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Gov. Kate Brown called the devastation from the blaze, which was at 191,238 acres with 20 percent containment, ""all-encompassing and shocking.""Still, she said, the forecast had good news: Rain is expected on the coast, as well as on both slopes of the Cascade Mountains, which span the state, beginning Thursday night. Another official, Andrew Phelps, director of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management, said the rain could cause flooding in the areas that have burned, however.The National Weather Service had issued flash flood watches across the state, he said, ""so please be cognizant of that.""Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."

Wilson Observatory from a giant wildfire burning north of Los Angeles, officials said Wednesday.In a news release, fire officials said that flames at the south end of the roughly 44,000-acre Bobcat Fire had calmed overnight, allowing crews to strengthen containment lines and prevent the blaze from damaging the 116-year-old observatory.On Tuesday, officials with the U.S. Forest Service said the blaze had been within 500 feet of the facility.“While there is still much work to be done in southwest and in the northern sections of the fire, your firefighters did incredible work around Mt. Wilson today,” forest officials tweeted late Tuesday.The observatory sits on a 5,700-foot peak in the Angeles National Forest, a 700,000-acre protected area in the San Gabriel Mountains. The forest is 25 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.The fire, which ignited Sept. 6, was only 3 percent contained on Wednesday.Heroes don’t wear capes. They wear personal protection equipment (PPE).

Four years later, Hubble was at Mount Wilson when he confirmed that the universe is still expanding.The Bobcat Fire is one of 25 major fires in California. A record 3.3 million acres have burned in California this year, and thousands of buildings have been destroyed. Twenty-five people have died, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.In Butte County, where the Camp Fire killed 85 people two years ago in the state's deadliest wildfire on record — and where 15 have died since a powerful off-shore wind event intensified the North Complex Fire last week — officials reported some progress Tuesday and said that no new humans were found.But the communities of Feather Falls, Berry Creek and Brush Creek suffered ""substantial"" damage, and hundreds of homes have been destroyed, the officials said.Ron Bravo, the deputy operations section chief working the fire response, said firefighters have been working hard on containment lines to keep the fire from spreading to the town of Paradise, which was devastated by the Camp Fire, and other nearby communities.""We're very confident that we're going to be able to have our lines in place and not have to worry about Paradise or Concow anywhere within the next seven days,"" he said.The North Complex West Zone was at more than 77,300 acres and was 29 percent contained; the overall North Complex has burned more than 273,000 acres and was 34 percent contained.A cold front expected for later this week will bring cooler temperatures, National Weather Service incident meteorologist Dan Borsum said.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and alertsState officials and experts have blamed climate change and a build up of dried-out vegetation for the dozens of fires that have scorched the state.Massive blazes have also raced across the Pacific Northwest, destroying towns and killing 10 people in Oregon and Washington.Meteorologists said Tuesday that a haze settling over a wide swath of the East Coast was smoke that had made its way east from the fires.Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.Phil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News."

Eight people have died.Blazes in Washington have charred more than 800,000 acres and destroyed 418 structures, including 195 homes.

""I guess they felt that if there was a change in circumstances they would be able to get out, and that proved to be a fatal error,"" he said.The identification of Catarancuic and Rubel's remains was announced Tuesday.Honea did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the status of the search for Susan Zurz.Butte County includes Paradise, a town that was destroyed in the 2018 Camp Fire, one of the deadliest fires on record in the state, which killed 85 people.Firefighters in Southern California said they have successfully defended Mount Wilson Observatory — a famous astronomical complex perched on a mile-high ridge in the San Gabriel Mountains — according to tweets posted by Angeles National Forest.""Assisted by the outstanding defensible space of Mt.

Gavin Newsom on Wednesday called the wildfires ""an unprecedented emergency"" and addressed the issue of warming temperatures, saying that since the 1980, the average temperature in the state between June and September rose from around 71 to about 74 degrees.""While that may not seem significant, three degrees, it is profoundly impactful,"" Newsom said.He said the state is working with the U.S. Forest Service to more than double the annual acreage of prescribed burns and other forest thinning practices, but that the issue of rising temperatures and climate change is a fundamental fact that cannot be denied.""There are no Democratic thermometers and no Republican thermometers,"" Newsom said. ""There's fact, and there's reality as well as observed evidence. It's not a belief system, it's an acknowledgment. The facts are the facts."""

She got a call Monday night about a downed power line, and the resulting brush fire spread faster than anything she had ever seen.Within an hour or two of having left her home to respond, Plews said, she had issued a level 3 evacuation order — for residents to leave immediately — for the McKenzie River area in Lane County in western Oregon. Her family left their home about 20 miles downriver from the fire's origins, able to bring a few of the animals on their property.The next evening, a neighboring fire chief told Plews that crews had done everything they could but that her home was gone.""I not only have my life to put back together, I also have a fire department to put back together,"" Plews said. ""And I honestly don't know how I'm going to do that.""Plews said she was awake for about 56 hours, with many of her crew members going even longer. The team battled the flames from Monday night until Thursday or Friday before returning Saturday, and the majority were given a 24-hour rest period by Sunday, Plews said.""I am all up and down and inside out,"" Plews said Sunday. ""At this point in time, I'm tired, and it's really minute to minute. I'm really good one minute and hopeful, and then the next minute I just can't do it. I'm lost.""Career firefighters from the Eugene-Springfield area were able to offer mutual aid, Plews said, a blessing with so many of the state's resources drained by the dozens of fires in Oregon. The fight against the Holiday Farm Fire is still in its early days, and Plews expects the struggle to stretch for quite some time. Most of the area's residents have been displaced and are eager to return home, she said.Plews expects that people might be angry, but with active fires on both sides of the road and unstable timber all around, it's unclear when anyone will be able to return to see what's left of their lives.""We cannot afford to have people go back to the homes that are there and then have to respond to that,"" Plews said. ""We literally don't have the people to respond to that.""The fire department's Blue River station is destroyed, its equipment is burned, and a number of the crew members have lost their homes and livelihoods in the past week. Almost all of them have been able to reunite with their loved ones in safe locations, although a few have stayed at the department's surviving station to keep fighting.Except for Plews, every firefighter on the team is a volunteer who adds the dangerous work to an already bustling life. Samantha Winningham, a lieutenant with the Upper McKenzie crew, is one of those volunteers.Winningham helps run her family's business, Meyer's General Store, in Blue River, where she has lived her entire life and where she and her husband are raising a 4-year-old daughter. Their home was just a block from her mother's in one direction. A few blocks in another direction, her aunt lived next to the storeNow all those homes are gone, along with the garden she'd been working on in her spare time and the album she kept on the bottom of a bookshelf with her grandparents' photographs.""Literally the whole town of Blue River is totally leveled, so three of our houses and our business, the fire station, the post office, the local clinic,"" Winningham said. ""And we're in a really small community, so a lot of our close family friends [lost their homes], too. It's all gone.""The family of about 16 are together in a hotel in Eugene, where nearly the entire town of Blue River is staying.Winningham's husband was pulling dinner out of the oven just as the calls came in about downed power lines Monday night. She left her home that night and hasn't been able to return since.She and the rest of the crew went door to door to evacuate families, dealing with heavy winds that sent embers that forced them to hide behind their equipment. All the while, there was barely any cell reception, making it difficult to even know how their loved ones were doing.Winningham said she left the fight Wednesday to reunite with her family after she realized she was no longer able to work effectively with the worry for her loved ones on her mind.""I was fighting a battle that I wasn't winning. Everything was just getting worse, and I wasn't at home able to help my family be safe, either,"" she said.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and alertsIn the days she has been able to spend with her family and almost everyone in their small town who has been displaced, Winningham said, she has been able to find some hope that Blue River will rebuild better than it was before.""Everyone in our town made it out and alive and safe,"" she said. ""As helpless as we feel as a department, we might not have been able to save the structures, but we were able to save the people. So at least we have that.""At least two GoFundMes were created to raise money for the chief on Friday, collectively gathering more than $40,000 for Plews and the department.""Rainbow made the call to raise the evacuation level early so that the citizens in her jurisdiction had time to get out safely,"" one of the fundraising organizers, Wren Arrington, said in the GoFundMe description. ""Rainbow is a full blown, grass roots, salt-of-the-earth hero.""Donations are also coming in for the displaced Lane County residents, people who need clothes and toiletries, Plews said. Although there have been some difficulties in getting everyone what they need in the turmoil of the last several days, Plews said, the community response has been overwhelming.""I know these long-term events, and there's that period in the beginning where everyone is there for everyone else, piles of donations, and there's a lot of fear and uncertainty but also a lot of hope,"" Plews said.The Holiday Farm Fire, which was only 5 percent contained Sunday, had scorched 161,872 acres, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group's incident information system.Andrew Phelps, Oregon's emergency management director, said in an interview with MSNBC that the state was preparing for a ""mass fatality incident.""""There are going to be a number of fatalities, folks who just couldn't get warning in time and evacuate their homes and get to safety,"" Phelps said Friday.At least 33 people have died in the dozens of fires along the West Coast, with dozens more missing and thousands of others displaced.

It merged this week with the Elkhorn Fire, becoming the largest wildfire in California history, officials with the U.S. Forest Service said.The wildfires in the Mendocino and Shasta-Trinity national forests in Northern California officially were put under the umbrella of the August Complex Fire, which originated with a series of lightning strikes on Aug. 17, early Friday, said Anne Grandy, a spokeswoman for the forest service.The newly expanded blaze was roughly 25 percent contained, or surrounded, according to forest service daily fire reports.The August Complex Fire is the product of more than 37 separate fires that ignited last month, boosted by triple-digit temperatures and dry offshore winds over Labor Day weekend.On Thursday, the August Complex supplanted 2018's Mendocino Complex Fire, which burned more than 459,000 acres, as the largest in state history. It is being managed by two federal teams and one from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, Grandy said.Additionally, 233 service members from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state were assisting with the firefight, the National Interagency Coordination Center said in a statement. They were working as hand crews and mop-up teams away from the flames, Grandy said.""It's not the most glamorous work, but it's really important work,"" she said.More than 1,400 firefighters were assigned to the August Complex Fire, which has damaged or destroyed 26 buildings and caused one death, a firefighter whose vehicle overturned last month.Since last month, at least 19 deaths have been linked to the California wildfires, according to an NBC News tally.

Gavin Newsom signed a new bill Friday that will accelerate the process for expunging the felony records of formerly incarcerated volunteer firefighters.The new law is designed to make it far easier for them to earn an emergency medical technician certification, the first step in becoming a professional firefighter in most cities and counties.For decades, thousands of inmate firefighters have battled wildfires across the state, working alongside professional firefighters in the scorching heat and smoke.Yet the men and women prisoners who throw themselves in danger to help save lives and property often find it impossible to put their firefighting skills to use after their release, even in a state desperate for such labor.CA’s inmate firefighter program is decades-old and has long needed reform.Inmates who have stood on the frontlines, battling historic fires should not be denied the right to later become a professional firefighter.Today, I signed #AB2147 that will fix that. pic.twitter.com/15GJ7Gijt7This system will now undergo a significant change under AB 2147, making it easier for them to earn an emergency medical technician certification, the first step in becoming a professional firefighter in most cities and counties.Former inmates have to disclose on applications for EMT programs and jobs whether they have been convicted of a felony. With the record eliminated, they could be considered as any other applicant. Some former inmates convicted of violent offenses, including arson, kidnapping, and rape would be barred from having their records expunged.“I think that after seeing all these young men and women stand side by side with our other fire crews and knowing that they had no hope of entering that profession, I knew that it was wrong and that we needed to do something about it,” Assemblymember Eloise Reyes, the bill’s author, said.The law received support from prisoners’ advocacy groups and at least one unlikely organization, the Los Angeles Lakers.Thank you to all of our firefighters and first responders, including our incarcerated men and women fighting the current California wildfires.Human rights are everyone’s rights. Create a pathway for former inmates who successfully completed fire camp while incarcerated. pic.twitter.com/U0j6TsfKBLCalifornia has about 3,700 incarcerated people working in the inmate firefighting program, with about 2,600 qualified to work fire lines.Some law enforcement groups, including the Peace Officers Research Association of California, say such a measure is unnecessary and even dangerous.Association President Brian Marvel said in an emailed statement that his organization valued the labor provided by the inmates and supports a pathway for low-level offenders to use their skills and experience to become firefighters after their release.“However, to allow people released from prison to have their records expunged immediately does not allow adequate time for formerly incarcerated individuals to fully reintegrate into society,” he said.California legislators push to let former prisoners become firefighters. “To fully expunge a felon’s record in exchange for this work is not warranted, is dangerous to the public and fails to recognize the impact to the victims of the inmate’s crimes,”https://t.co/xexWttcliAActivists complain the state’s reliance on incarcerated labor to fight wildfires is unfair because prisoners receive only $1 an hour while working on an active fire line. A professional firefighter just starting out can earn about $40,000 a year.The activists say that having the former inmates work as regular firefighters in a state pummeled by increasingly frequent and severe wildfires outweighs any drawbacks.“I am definitely pleased that the bill passed and I think that it is a great step in the right direction,” said Brandon Smith, executive director of the Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program, a nonprofit that helps former inmates who served as firefighters, like himself, to obtain professional, fire-related employment after their release from prison.Smith said the law would likely benefit first-time offenders, who are less likely to have other disqualifying circumstances, more than someone like himself, who has two separate felony convictions that would have to be expunged.Please @GavinNewsom sign #AB2147!!!

On Tuesday afternoon, Mays, a music teacher, saw smoke from the approaching North Complex West Zone fire, and knew something was wrong.But Mays had no power, and thus no reliable cell phone service, so she hadn’t received any emergency alert to warn her of the dangerous fire. In fact, she had no Wi-Fi or even water, because her cabin and 70 acres rely on a well. In an effort to prevent more wildfires from igniting, California’s largest utility provider, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) had intentionally shut off power the previous night to Mays and more than 150,000 other customers across 22 counties in Northern California.The North Complex West Zone fire has already killed 10 people and burned more than 70,000 acres in Butte County. The fire was caused by lightning more than a month ago, but is still just 5 percent contained.Mays scoured the Butte County Sheriff and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) websites as best she could with her limited reception. “It was two hours past the evacuation order before I could even see the [evacuation] map on my phone,” Mays told NBC News.She and her roommate gathered up her most prized musical instruments and furnishings, plus two dogs and three chickens, and loaded as much as they could fit in the car.“As I walked away from the house, I thought, ‘that house is kindling.’ Even the inside is solid wood paneling. It’s a matchstick house,” explained Mays, who is still evacuated and doesn’t know if her beloved cabin has been consumed by the fire or not.“I totally understand why PG&E has to turn the power off with those high winds. I get it. But there has to be some consideration for the fact that we all need to keep the water going and cell phone reception.”In a press release, PG&E said it uses “Public Safety Power Shutoffs” (PSPS) “only as the last resort to protect community and customer safety against wildfires, given dry and windy weather, dry vegetation and an elevated fire risk across portions of its service area.” The utility says that wind gusts of up to 66 miles per hour were recorded during the PSPS and that there were dozens of incidents of damage that could have caused wildfire ignitions, including downed power lines.But, as California residents contend with the coronavirus pandemic and resulting distance learning on top of deadly wildfires, for many, the timing of the outage couldn’t have been worse.School districts across the state had to scramble to come up with a way to keep virtual learning going despite the planned outages. In Rincon Valley Union School District, which includes the fire-torn city of Santa Rosa, Assistant Superintendent Mike Herfurth said teachers spent their Labor Day planning for virtual schooling with no power across five campuses. “They had to work on Monday, a holiday, to email all the families and let them know what assignments to do over the next two days since they wouldn’t have access to email” or be able to teach virtually on Tuesday or Wednesday.“There’s already such a huge learning curve for teachers, students, and parents just on distance learning — and to have the power outage thrown into that, it was a big effect,” Herfurth said. “We are completely having to reinvent how we are doing distance learning.”In all, more than 2,000 students in the district weren’t able to participate in live instruction due to the planned PG&E power outages.Bernadette Calhoun teaches high school math at Healdsburg High School, and has been conducting her classes on Zoom since March. Last month, the explosive Walbridge Fire threatened the entire town of Healdsburg — the town was evacuated and school was canceled for days. So, when she learned she, too, would lose power in the PSPS on Tuesday, she thought, “‘These kids didn’t have school for days. And now, this. I just can’t upend their lives again.’ I just decided to figure out how best to teach them.”That meant finding another location with internet for her to teach classes: in her case, Calhoun’s 80-year-old mother’s house in Sonoma. “But I didn’t want to go inside [because of the risk of coronavirus], so I just sat on the porch to use the Wi-Fi.”Unfortunately, on Wednesday, Sonoma’s skies were also darkened because of wildfire smoke, even in the middle of the day — to the point that street lamps remained illuminated and cars had to drive with headlights on.As Calhoun sat outside on the porch, maskless and teaching her high schoolers from her laptop, “it was dark and raining ash in Sonoma. It was hard, and I ended up with a headache. I can still feel it in my sinuses today,” she said by phone on Thursday.“You can’t quit, so you just keep doing the best you can,” Calhoun said. “I think part of why any of us go into teaching, certainly why I did, is because I want to be around kids. I love working with teachers, and it’s hard when you don’t have the personal connection.”“I just feel like we can’t win this year.”Parents, too, are adapting the best they can to the added obstacle of these PSPS events.In the hamlet of Glen Ellen, famous for its wine, Lauren Benward-Krause has been balancing the daily operations of the inn and winery at her family’s historic Beltane Ranch while also trying to assist her two sons with their distance learning. Ahead of Tuesday’s planned power outage, Benward-Krause charged devices for sons Carlos, 7, and Drake, 5, plus rigged up a generator and a very long extension cord in order to power a Wi-Fi hotspot — all to keep the kids learning online.“It’s better than being on fire, and I understand why they do it,” Benward-Krause said, referring to the planned power outages. “I just feel like we can’t win this year.” With the sun choked out by wildfire smoke, her sons spent Tuesday and Wednesday learning by laptop and candlelight. “It was extremely dark because it was the apocalypse outside,” joked Benward-Krause about the unhealthy orange sky.Fire is no stranger to Beltane Ranch. In October of 2017, the Tubbs Fire tore through the 105-acre property so quickly that a car belonging to one of the inn’s guests burned to ashes in the parking lot.“This isn’t our first rodeo,” Benward-Krause said with a knowing laugh. “We’ve been out of power every year now. It’s like camping; we try to have fun with it. It proved really inconvenient for online learning, but the rest is okay for us.” The working mother of two lauds her sons’ teachers and school for adapting quickly to make online learning engaging, and creating physical packets of organized coursework. But still, she says, her son “spent half of the first day [of distance learning] crying underneath the desk. It’s hard for them.”“It’s time-consuming as a working parent, but at last I have flexibility with work. I can get up early to answer emails and I live on the property so can run over and take care of something” she said, adding that she tries to catch up by working nights and weekends. “I have some advantages, but still it’s a lot for anybody.”It’s peak harvest season in wine country, and normally Beltane Ranch would be booked full. But, like many small businesses, they’re operating at decreased capacity and spacing reservations — and the inn was closed altogether for three months this spring due to the pandemic. Even now, “between the smoke and power outages and extreme heat, we have had a lot of cancellations. It’s down considerably. We’re grateful to those who are coming so we can keep our team at work,” Benward-Krause said.Back in Butte County, Danielle Mays still doesn’t know if her home is standing. “I have some hope, but it doesn’t look good,” she said, poring over fire incident maps. She hopes to see the emergency alert system improve so that evacuation alerts improve geolocation and arrive with the same volume and urgency as AMBER alerts.“I was in love with living up there and the surrounding community and all the nice people in the area. We need to think about how we deal with these power outages or at least be cognizant of the fact that in that area, with the power out, we don’t have the cell reception to load a map.”Chiara Sottile is a producer and reporter covering business and technology for NBC News."

More than 40,000 Oregonians have evacuated, the state emergency management agency said Friday. Thursday night, the state joint information center said 500,000 had been in areas under mandatory evacuation orders.At least four deaths in the state this week have been blamed on the fires, according to officials.Oregon Gov.

I just watched everything burn,"" said Jonathan Weir, whose home was destroyed.People spent the night in their cars in a Home Depot parking lot on the town's outskirts before returning to what was left of the town Thursday. In the city of Talent, with a population of around 6,000 southeast of Phoenix, the fire ""ripped through"" the main corridor, Mayor Darby Ayers-Flood has said.In Clackamas County, Oregon, south of Portland, two large fires, the Beachie Creek and Riverside fires, were expected to merge, said Lance Lighty of the state's fire marshal's officeThe entire county was under evacuation orders or warnings. ""We've seen fire situations over the last three days in Oregon that we've never seen before,"" Lighty said.In another fire burning in Northern California, near and across the Oregon border, another person was discovered dead Thursday, according to a sheriff's official.The Slater Fire, which is burning in the Klamath National Forest and has destroyed an estimated 150 homes in the area of the small community of Happy Camp, had been blamed for at least one other death.The Slater Fire has grown to more than 120,000 acres, fire officials said.Wildfires have also been burning in Washington state, where at least one death linked to the fires.Gov. Jay Inslee on Thursday visited the devastated town of Malden, where he estimated 80 percent of the community of about 260 in the eastern part of the state was destroyed by wildfire.""We've had this trauma all over Washington,"" Inslee said, according to NBC affiliate KHQ of Spokane. ""But this is the place where the whole heart of the town was torn out.""The deadly fire season has been record-setting in California, where hundreds of fires were sparked by thousands of lightning strikes in August.Eight people were killed in those blazes, including five people who died in the LNU Complex burning northeast of San Francisco and near Vacaville and other communities.That fire has burned more than 363,000 acres and damaged or destroyed nearly 1,500 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. It was 94 percent contained Thursday.Southern California is also battling several blazes, including the Bobcat Fire burning in Angeles National Forest near Los Angeles.That fire was at more than 23,000 acres Thursday night and was 6 percent contained, and residents in cities of Monrovia, Pasadena and others were told to prepare to evacuate, according to fire officials.The El Dorado Fire in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, east of Los Angeles, was about 13,600 acres Thursday evening and had destroyed 10 structures, according to Cal Fire.

It has so far burned 471,185 acres and is 24 percent contained.Forest Service spokesman Terry Krasko suggested that the fire may actually be bigger. He said an airplane with infrared capabilities that measure the size of a blaze was out of service Thursday.The fire became known as the August Complex Fire about five days ago, when numerous blazes combined, Krasko said. Many smaller fires have been extinguished, he said, but larger parts of the fire, including the Doe Fire, continued to grow Thursday afternoon.The August Complex Fire unseated the previous largest fire, 2018's Mendocino Complex Fire, which burned more than 459,000 acres.Federal officials say triple-digit temperatures and offshore gusts gave the fire a growth spurt over Labor Day weekend. The forecast in the area calls for calmer winds and cooler high temperatures in the high 80s and low 90s.Thunderstorms, the suspected culprit in sparking the blaze, were forecast to return Tuesday.California's August fires, including three of the four largest in state history — the August Complex Fire, the 396,624-acre SCU (Santa Clara Unit) Lightning Complex Fire and the 363,220-acre LNU (Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit) Lightning Complex Fire — prompted President Donald Trump to criticize state officials Aug. 23.""You've got to clean your floors.
