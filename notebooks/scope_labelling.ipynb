      "‘This is result of climate change,’ says Venice mayor, who declares state of emergency  Two people have died as the highest water levels for more than 50 years caused hundreds of millions of euros of possibly irreparable damage in Venice, officials have said, with another surge expected to cause further flooding. Flood levels in the lagoon city reached the second highest level since records began in 1923 as a result of the acqua alta, which hit 1.87 metres  late on Tuesday night amid heavy rain, just short of the record 1.94 metres measured in 1966. Another deluge engulfed the city on Wednesday morning, causing the acqua alta, or high water, to reach 1.60 metres. Most of the water had receded by the afternoon, but residents are bracing themselves for more to come as forecasts predicted high tides of 1.20 metres late on Wednesday night and 1.30 metres on Thursday morning. An elderly local man from Pellestrina, one of the many islands in the Venetian lagoon, died when he was struck by lightning while using an electric water pump, the fire brigade said. The body of another man was found in his home. More than 85% of Venice was flooded, authorities said, including the historic St Mark’s basilica. While the water level dropped slightly on Wednesday morning, a further torrent of water, whipped up by high winds, is forecast to sweep in later in the day, reaching a level of 1.60 metres. The mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, said he would declare a state of emergency, adding that the flood levels represented a wound that would leave indelible marks. “We ask the government to help us. This is the result of climate change,” he said, putting the damage in the hundreds of millions of euros. Italy’s minister of culture, Dario Franceschini, said the government would provide an as yet unspecified amount of funding to help preserve the Unesco world heritage site. Venice sits on thousands of wooden piles driven into the mud, but rising sea levels and heavy cruise ship traffic have steadily eaten away at the surrounding marshes and mudbanks, causing the city to gradually sink. St Mark’s Square was submerged by more than one metre of water, while the adjacent basilica was flooded for only the sixth time in 1,200 years – but the fourth in the last two decades. The last occasion, in November 2018, caused an estimated €2.2m  of damage. The archbishop of Venice, Francesco Moraglia, said St Marks had suffered “structural damage, because the water has risen. This is causing irreparable harm, especially – when it dries out – in the lower section of the mosaics and tiling.” Carlo Alberto Tesserin, who heads the team responsible for managing the historic site, told Agence France Presse the water had surged into the basilica with a force “never seen before, not even in the 1966 flood”. Warnings about potential damage from increasingly high tides “went unheeded”, Tesserin said, adding: “The damage we see now is nothing compared to that within the walls. The salt enters the marble, the bricks, everywhere.” The governor of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, described a scene of “apocalyptic devastation”, saying the city was “on its knees”. “The art, the basilica, the shops and the homes, a disaster ... Venice is bracing itself for the next high tide,” he said. Brugnaro also pledged that the multibillion euro Mose project, designed in 1984 to protect Venice from high tides but still not in operation, would be completed. Work began in 2003 but has been dogged by delays and myriad issues, including a corruption scandal that emerged in 2014. The head of the Venice hotels association said the damage was enormous, with many hotels losing electricity and lacking pumps to remove water. Tourists with ground floor rooms had to be evacuated to higher floors as the waters rose on Tuesday night, Claudio Scarpa told the Ansa press agency. The coastguard provided extra boats to serve as water ambulances. Tables and chairs set out for aperitifs bobbed along flooded alleyways in the dark, as locals and tourists waved aloft umbrellas, the water slopping over the top of waders and wellies. Water taxis attempting to drop people off at the historic hotels along the Grand Canal discovered that gangways had been washed away, and had to help passengers clamber through windows. At the sumptuous Gritti Palace, which has played host to royals and celebrities over the decades, including Ernest Hemingway, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, the bar was largely underwater. Rich tapestries were piled on to tables, while the waters lapped around velvet sofas and leatherbound books. Two French tourists said they had “effectively swum” after some of the wooden platforms placed around the city in areas prone to flooding overturned. The overnight surge also triggered several fires, including one at the International Gallery of Modern Art Ca’ Pesaro. Video on social media showed deep water flowing like a river along one of Venice’s main thoroughfares. Other footage showed large waves hammering boats moored alongside the Doge’s Palace and surging over the stone sidewalks. Much of Italy has been pummelled by torrential rainfall in recent days, with widespread flooding, especially in the southern heel and toe of the country. Further bad weather is forecast for the coming days.\n",

      "This video can not be played Severe flooding in Venice that has left much of the Italian city under water is a direct result of climate change, the mayor says.  The highest water levels in the region in more than 50 years would leave a permanent mark, Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted. Now the government must listen, he added. These are the effects of climate change... the costs will be high. The waters in Venice peaked at 1.87m , according to the tide monitoring centre. Only once since official records began in 1923 has the tide been higher, reaching 1.94m in 1966.  Images showed popular sites left completely flooded and people wading through the streets as Venice was hit by a storm.  St Mark Square   one of the lowest parts of the city   was one of the worst hit areas.  St Mark Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years, according to church records. Pierpaolo Campostrini, a member of St Mark council, said four of those floods had now occurred within the past 20 years.  The mayor said the famous landmark had suffered grave damage. The crypt was completely flooded and there are fears of structural damage to the basilica columns. The city of Venice is made up of more than 100 islands inside a lagoon off the north east coast of Italy. Two people died on the island of Pellestrina, a thin strip of land that separates the lagoon from the Adriatic Sea. A man was electrocuted as he tried to start a pump in his home, and a second person was found dead elsewhere. Mr Brugnaro said the damage was huge and that he would declare a state of disaster, warning that a project to help prevent the Venetian lagoon suffering devastating floods must be finished soon.  The situation is dramatic. We ask the government to help us, he said on Twitter, adding that schools would remain closed until the water level subsides.  He also urged local businesses to share photos and video footage of the devastation, which he said would be useful when requesting financial help from the government.  People throughout the city waded through the flood waters.  A number of businesses were affected. Chairs and tables were seen floating outside cafes and restaurants.  In shops, workers tried to move their stock away from the water to prevent any further damage.  One shopkeeper, who was not named, told Italy public broadcaster Rai: The city is on its knees. Three waterbuses sank, but tourists continued their sightseeing as best they could.  One French couple told AFP news agency that they had effectively swum after some of the wooden platforms placed around the city in areas prone to flooding overturned.  On Wednesday morning, a number of boats were seen stranded.  A project to protect the city from flooding has been under way since 2003 but has been hit by soaring costs, scandals and delays.  The so called Mose project   a series of large barriers or floodgates that would be raised from the seabed to shut off the lagoon in the event of rising sea levels and winter storms   was successfully tested for the first time in 2013. The project has already cost billions of euros in investment. According to Italy infrastructure ministry, the flood barriers will be handed over to the Venice city council at the end of 2021 following the final phase of testing.  Italy was hit by heavy rainfall on Tuesday with further bad weather forecast in the coming days. Venice suffers flooding on a yearly basis. By BBC meteorologist Nikki Berry The recent flooding in Venice was caused by a combination of high spring tides and a meteorological storm surge driven by strong sirocco winds blowing north eastwards across the Adriatic Sea. When these two events coincide, we get what is known as Acqua Alta . This latest Acqua Alta occurrence in Venice is the second highest tide in recorded history. However, if we look at the top 10 tides, five have occurred in the past 20 years and the most recent was only last year.  While we should try to avoid attributing a single event to climate change, the increased frequency of these exceptional tides is obviously a big concern. In our changing climate, sea levels are rising and a city such as Venice, which is also sinking, is particularly susceptible to such changes.  The weather patterns that have caused the Adriatic storm surge have been driven by a strong meridional  jet stream across the northern hemisphere and this has fed a conveyor belt of low pressure systems into the central Mediterranean.  One of the possible effects of a changing climate is that the jet stream will be more frequently meridional and blocked weather patterns such as these will also become more frequent. If this happens, there is a greater likelihood that these events will combine with astronomical spring tides and hence increase the chance of flooding in Venice.  Furthermore, the meridional jet stream can be linked back to stronger typhoons in the north west Pacific resulting in more frequent cold outbreaks in North America and an unsettled Mediterranean is another one of the downstream effects.

      "Rightwing parties reject proposals as lagoon city faces worst flooding in 53 years  Veneto’s regional council rejected a plan to combat climate change minutes before its offices on the Grand Canal, in Venice, were flooded, it has emerged as the city continues to battle high water levels. Venice has been hit by recurrent flooding since Tuesday, with 70% of the lagoon city engulfed on Friday morning as the acqua alta, or high water, level reached 1.54 metres amid heavy downpours.  On Tuesday night, as Veneto councillors were debating the climate emergency in Ferro Fini Palace, Venice experienced its worst flooding since 1966. Politicians from the regional council’s majority rightwing parties: the League, Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia, rejected amendments to fight the climate crisis in the 2020 budget that were proposed by the centre left Democratic party. Sharing pictures of the room as water entered, Andrea Zanoni, the Democratic party’s deputy chairman of the council’s environment committee, wrote on Facebook: “Ironically, the chamber was flooded two minutes after the majority parties rejected our proposals to tackle climate change.” Zanoni, a green campaigner, said the proposals included measures to fund renewable energy sources, replace diesel buses with less polluting vehicles, scrap polluting stoves and reduce plastic use. “There is no more meaningful image than a chamber being flooded, causing the representatives of the Venetian people to flee, to illustrate all the inconsistency and political nullity of a current miserable administrative led by the League, Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia,” he added. Zanoni took particular aim at Luca Zaia, the Veneto president and League politician, for presenting a budget that contained “no concrete plan to tackle climate change”. Zaia has described the Venice flooding, which has killed two people, as “an apocalyptic disaster”. “Venice has been tortured, but there are also other parts of the Veneto region besides Venice,” he said on Wednesday. In a statement to CNN, Roberto Ciambetti, the council’s president and League member, rebuffed the criticism. “Beyond propaganda and deceptive reading, we are voting  a regional budget that spent €965m over the past three years in the fight against air pollution, smog, which is a determining factor in climate change,” he said. Venice’s mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, blamed the floods on the climate crisis and promised that the long delayed Mose flood barrier project would be finished. Brugnaro closed St Mark’s Square as the tide started to rise again on Friday morning, engulfing shops, restaurants and homes. “I’m forced to close the square to avoid health risks for citizens ... a disaster,” he said. “We’ve destroyed Venice, we’re talking about €1bn in damage and that’s just from the other day, not today.” The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, declared a state of emergency on Thursday night, paving the way for the government to assist people whose businesses and homes had been damaged. Conte said the flooding was “a blow to the heart of our country”. Residents whose homes have been flooded will receive €5,000 immediately while restaurant and shop owners will get up to €20,000. Brugnaro said a bank account would be opened to allow people from around the world to contribute towards repairing the city. Water engulfed St Mark’s Basilica, flooding the crypt and smashing windows. It is unclear how much repairs will cost, but when water filled the 1,000 year old cathedral in November 2018 the repair costs were estimated at €2.2m. The opera house, the Teatro La Fenice, was also damaged and a short circuit caused a fire at Ca’ Pesaro gallery. On the island of Murano, the mosaic floors of the cathedral were seriously damaged.\n",

      "The remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda dumped up to 43 inches of rain. Water rescues underway after rain slams Texas Five Houston area deaths are now blamed on Tropical Storm Imelda as Texas residents fight through hazardous flooding that brought the region to a standstill, leaving hundreds of cars swamped and abandoned. The remnants of Imelda dumped up to 43 inches of rain within three days in the areas between Winnie and Beaumont, east of Houston. Most of that rain fell in just 24 hours. Some residents whose homes were flooded by Hurricane Harvey two years ago are now seeing rain seeping into their houses yet again. It was really just intense rainfall that wouldn't stop. It was very  Harvey like, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said. On Friday, Houston emergency workers  discovered a man body in a ditch and said they believed he had drowned. Authorities also said two drivers had died in their cars as a result of the flooding, including the driver of a stalled 2017 Dodge pickup truck on Interstate 10 who was discovered dead after floodwaters receded, and a 47 year old Beaumont resident who was declared dead after his body was found inside his vehicle in Jefferson County. Earlier, authorities reported two deaths on Thursday as the floodwaters rose: one man who drowned after driving into floodwaters and a second man who was electrocuted and drowned while trying to move his horse, according to authorities. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday declared a state of disaster for 13 counties as the floodwaters climbed up to the door handles of SUVs. In Harris County, which encompasses Houston, more than 1,000 people were rescued. Some residents used tractors and air boats to pull other to safety. A Harris County Sheriff sergeant was heading to rescue a man stranded in floodwaters early Friday when the fast current trapped him, Sheriff Gonzalez said. The sergeant, who had lost all contact with the department, clung to a tree branch to avoid the quick current until both men could be rescued, Gonzalez said. We collectively just held our breath for a minute ... we're just all relieved, said the sheriff, who knows the sergeant personally. Jayden Payne, a student at Aldine Senior High School in Houston, was in the car with his mom when he saw an SUV head into a ditch    and it was going down fast. Payne said he ran over, dodging other cars, and dove into the water to help pull a mother and daughter to safety. I was frightened for the little girl because I could tell she was 4 years old. And I was like, 'She too young for her life to get taken away right now,' he told ABC News. They were both too young. Houston, the nation 4th largest city, saw over 9 inches of rainfall on Thursday, the wettest September day ever recorded there. About 200 students from the Aldine Independent School District were forced to spend the night at school after they couldn't get home due to the flooding, ABC Houston station KTRK reported. Houston public schools were closed Friday. This week downpour is the fourth highest amount of rain from a tropical system in Texas' recorded history, as well as the seventh highest amount of rain from a tropical system in U.S. recorded history. Hurricane Harvey brought 60 inches of rain to Texas two years ago, which remains the U.S. record for most rain from a tropical system. And the threat isn't over. Scattered showers and thunderstorms hovered over southeastern Texas Friday afternoon, and officials said heavy downpours could still strike, which would exacerbate the already saturated ground conditions.

      "Almost 50 flood warnings are in place across England after days of persistent rain. Five severe warnings   deemed a threat to life   remain on South Yorkshire River Don, with flooding in that area likely to continue until Wednesday. Towns and cities across Yorkshire and the Midlands have faced disruption and in some cases emergency evacuations. Former High Sherriff of Derbyshire Annie Hall was swept to her death by the flooded River Derwent near Matlock. In addition to the severe warnings, the Environment Agency earlier issued a further 43 warnings   meaning flooding is expected   and 103 alerts. It said water levels were still very high on stretches of the River Don and expected flooding in that area until midweek.  A military helicopter would be used on Sunday evening to drop sandbags at Bentley Ings by the river. On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited flood hit Derbyshire on Friday, said he was in awe of the community spirit and resilience in the face of this awful ongoing event. He said he was receiving regular briefings on the situation and added the government emergency Bellwin scheme had been activated to reimburse eligible councils for certain costs they incur. Doncaster Council reiterated its call to evacuate Fishlake and has set up a rest centre in nearby Stainforth for as long as is needed. According to the Salvation Army, some people had been rescued from their homes by boat since the early hours of Saturday morning but others remained in their properties. Damian Allen, chief executive of Doncaster Council, said: We are concerned over reports that some residents remain in the Fishlake area. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue crews are on hand to evacuate any Fishlake residents who may be stuck in their homes, and we would urge everybody to take advantage of this. The council are unable to offer on the ground support to residents who are in severe flood warning areas, based on advice from the Environment Agency. The authority said it expected it would be at least 48 hours until you can return to your homes, if not longer and was told by the Environment Agency that flood waters in the village would not start to go down for at least the next 24 hours. â ï ̧URGENT Fishlake residents have been advised to evacuate, if you are still in Fishlake call 01302 735688 so we can organise evacuation immediately by South Yorks Fire and Rescue. We can only offer dedicated support to people who are not in an area where there is a threat to life Helen Batt, from the agency, said 4,000 properties had been protected by flood defences in the village, but added 300 had been flooded, with more than 1,200 evacuated. BBC reporter Richard Cadey said some roads around Fishlake had been closed and the village was effectively cut off because of flooding.  Many parts of the area remain under 3ft  of water and only tractors are able to get in by some roads. He said people on the ground had told him 90% of the homes there had been flooded. Pam Webb, who owns a spa in Fishlake, said: We've got blue skies, it looks picturesque until you actually get in to the village and you see the devastation that been caused to homes and businesses. Devastating is an easy word to use but it completely devastating and it heartbreaking. By Richard Cadey, BBC Radio Sheffield reporter Trying to get to Fishlake seemed like an impossible task. The village has suffered severe flooding and I was constantly met by road and bridge closures. In nearby Stainforth people had collected food in the local pub and taken it to those stranded in Fishlake by tractor. But now even this has become impractical. Richard Pashley family farm in neighbouring South Bramwith dates to 1910.  The 63 year old told me he had never seen flooding as bad as this in his lifetime. He put it down to a number of different factors, including torrential rainfall and the lack of dredging on the River Don.  This was a recurring concern from a number of residents and they all echoed Mr Pashley call for dredging to begin again on this section of the river. The fields surrounding these villages were like lakes and Mr Pashley field of potatoes was submerged by up to five feet of water, just two weeks before he was due to harvest them.  National Rail said a number of routes were affected by flooding and advised those travelling by train to check before setting out. Some train routes between Doncaster and Sheffield were closed and Northern Rail has warned commuters they are likely to remain shut until further notice. In Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, 12 properties remained evacuated after a landslide at an old quarry site saw debris and soil fall onto Band End Close.  Bassetlaw District Council said it was being removed and temporary safety measures had been put in place.  Natalie and Jonathan Palmer were evacuated from their home in Mansfield, along with their children, and are staying in a hotel.  They said they had been told they would not be able to return to their property for at least a fortnight, adding they were disgusted and angry at the prospect.  This video can not be played In Newark, people living in mobile homes were evacuated on Saturday evening as river levels peaked in the town.  Major incidents were declared on Friday in Worksop after the River Ryton burst its banks and in South Yorkshire as a result of wide spread flooding. Parts of Worksop were without power on Saturday. Firefighters evacuated 25 homes, and a community information point has been set up for those affected by the floods.  In Derby city centre, officials considered a city wide evacuation as authorities saw the River Derwent swell to record levels of 3.35m . This gives you an idea of the water level   and the speed at which the Derwent is flowing in Derby.And yes, those are flood defences being built on Exeter Bridge right now. #flooding pic.twitter.com/HNTT4BdDZ1 Communities around Matlock, Derbyshire, where flood victim Annie Hall was swept away, are cleaning up after the flooding.  Rowsley Church of England Primary School is trying to raise Â£5,000 after its classrooms were heavily damaged.  Governor Marianne Quick said: The school will remain closed until it has been expertly assessed but the likelihood of our children getting back into their much loved classrooms anytime soon is unlikely. Resident Sarah Sutcliffe said: Parents, teachers and especially the children are all distraught about the damage which has been caused. One of the most severely hit areas has been Bentley in Doncaster, where flooding affected many homes 12 years ago.  One resident told BBC Radio Sheffield: The worry is our insurance policies are expensive as it is because of the 2007 floods, so now we're all worried whether we're going to get reinsured. Some residents were angry and frustrated at Doncaster Council   claiming it had not provided sandbags early enough to prevent properties from flooding, the station reported. This video can not be played Homes in Stainforth, Thorpe in Balne and Trumfleet have also been evacuated. South Yorkshire Police said it had extra officers out on patrol to protect the evacuated areas and support those affected by the floods. There is no suggestion of any criminality resulting from the floods but we hope our extra patrols can offer at least a little reassurance to those worst affected.

      "Sheffield shopping centre cut off by rising waters as torrential rain deluges large areas and Met Office warns of more to come Dozens of people have been trapped in Sheffield’s Meadowhall shopping centre overnight after torrential rain caused flooding throughout the city and transport chaos across large parts of northern England. Heavy rain across the region on Thursday made roads impassable and forced the cancellation of train services, while 35 homes were evacuated in Mansfield after a mudlside. More flooding was expected on Friday but the downpours were set to ease later in the day. The Met Office’s amber weather warning for heavy rain covering parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands is in place until 6am and communities were braced for more more evacuations. Shoppers attending Meadowhall’s Christmas Live event were stranded in the complex after a nearby river burst its banks and flooded the surrounding area. Roads around the centre, including the M1 motorway, quickly became gridlocked and police advised people to remain inside. Harriet Fullen, 16, who travelled for the Christmas event from Lincoln by train with her friends, said they had queued all afternoon at Meadowhall but were told at 5.20pm that it had been called off. It was supposed to feature acts including Ella Henderson, Tom Zanetti and Jonas Blue. With many roads still blocked and trains and trams to the city cancelled, they were among 50 60 people who were forced to stay the night as water started coming into the shopping centre “from the lower level doors”. “We had to go and buy our own blankets and pillows and food and drink to supply ourselves, not to mention the new outfits we had to buy due to how wet through ours were from the day,” she said by email from the centre Oasis dining area where most of the 50 60 people had taken shelter.  The student, who is studying health and social care at Riseholme College, said people were stuck inside with most trying to sleep in the centre’s dining quarter. “We have then not had many updates given to us and nor do we know what it’s like outside. We are stuck here until the morning awaiting information of whether we are able to leave tomorrow or not. People have gone to restaurants to sleep on the booths as all of us are shattered.” Ethan Rylett, a 23 year old sales representative at a dentistry supply business near Meadowhall, said he began to notice the rising water level from his office around noon, and was dismissed from work in the early afternoon. “I’m stressed about the impact it could have on the business,” he said. “We did as much as we can to get as much stock from ground level but we’ve got a lot of technical equipment that’s built in to the workstations,” he added. Students in university accommodation on the banks of the river were forced to abandon their cars, as vehicles were submerged by flooding in the underground car park. “A lot of people who own cars here are very stressed,” Lucy Pearson, a 20 year old student said. “It looks like there are cars that are being consumed by the water and are now in too deep to be retrieved.” Later on Thursday night, Meadowhall, which flooded in 2007, said most people had left the mall by the time it officially closed at 10pm “but there are a small number of people who have chosen to stay with us for the time being. We will continue to look after them until they can return home safely”. It said the floods had not breached the building. While Sheffield was badly hit, South Yorkshire police said there were also “significant issues” in Rotherham and Doncaster, with Bentley, Toll Bar and Scawthorpe the worst affected areas. The force said: “The local authority are asking that people do not drive or leave their properties unless necessary.” Police were also called to the Parkgate shopping park in Rotherham on Thursday night, amid reports shoppers were trapped inside due to flood waters. South Yorkshire police tweeted that they were working to move “a number of people” who were stranded in the complex to “a place of safety”. The highest rainfall in the country on Thursday was recorded at Swineshaw in the Peak District, which had 112mm in the 24 hours to 2am. “There were a lot of other places that had 80mm or more, especially in Yorkshire,” a Met Office spokesman said. “The rains should clear by lunchtime, with a fine weekend ahead, but the flood warnings will stay in place for quite a while.” Concerns were also growing in the Calder Valley in west Yorkshire as river levels began to rise. Precautionary flood barriers were put in place in Mytholmroyd, which was badly hit in the 2015 Boxing Day floods. The weather has also caused train services to be cancelled and Northern Rail issued a “do not travel” warning to commuters using three routes, saying flooding had closed the lines between Sheffield and Gainsborough, Sheffield and Lincoln and Hebden Bridge and Manchester Victoria. By 10.30pm on Thursday, the Environment Agency had issued 98 flood warnings and 117 flood alerts. Further south in Nottinghamshire, police, firefighters and council officials were called to Bank End Close in Mansfield just before 5pm on Thursday following concerns for the safety of people living in the houses after a mudslide.\n",

Click here if you’re unable to view the gallery or video on your mobile device.  GUERNEVILLE Stranded amid a sea of river water, the town of Guerneville woke up to figure out just how bad the Russian River was to them this time. Fife Creek Antiques on River Road? Flooded to the rain gutters. The historic River Theater downtown? Water over the stage. The Style Bar on Third Street? Up to the doorknobs. After the worst flood in a quarter century hit here, some 3,000 homes and buildings including about 75 percent of downtown Guerneville are inundated. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Thursday, and roads leading into town were expected to remain closed until at least Friday. “It’s nerve wracking. People are standing on the edge of the water waiting to see if their home is still there,” said Jennifer Parnham, whose garage below her house already had flooded, and she feared her vacation rental nearby was underwater, too. “We deal with this every year, but in the 23 years I’ve been here, this is the worst I’ve seen it.” The locals dread not only the damage to their own homes and businesses but the exodus of newcomers that happens after every major flood. “Not all of them are going to come back, so we go through a little recession every time this happens,” Parham said. The old timers, though, are a different breed. “They know how to roll. We’re river rats.” On Wednesday, as the river crested 13.4 feet above flood stage at 45.4 feet and coursed through the first floors of many homes in Drake’s Estates, many neighbors took out their kayaks and paddled to a high spot, lit a bonfire and toasted the relentless river. “As soon as the water started rising, everybody had a beer,” said Jaime Wilson, who joined the bonfire while water streamed toward her downstairs garage. “There’s not much else we can do. So let’s bring up our spirits and deal with the aftermath when it happens, try to stay optimistic and not freak out the kids.” The aftermath isn’t pretty in her neighborhood, but it could be worse. After the historic floods in 1986 and 1995, FEMA funds helped homeowners elevate their homes about 12 feet. Living areas remained on the second story, while the ground level was meant for vehicles and storage. But many have been tempted to do more with their extra square footage and were regretting it Thursday. “When my son started high school, he needed an extra room away from his siblings, so we put in flooring and insulated it and walls and all that,” Wilson said. By Thursday it was well underwater. The family spent Thursday hauling out muddy bedding and furniture to the front yard. Most downtown businesses were left to the wiles of the river. And for Jerry Knight, who owns the historic River Theater, where Frank Sinatra, Count Basie and the Jerry Garcia Band once took the stage, it means starting over. Floodwaters poured over his stage, damaging equipment, memorabilia and the newly upholstered seating. “It’s a catastrophic loss,” Knight said Thursday. Like many business owners, he couldn’t afford flood insurance. It would have cost him $22,000 a year, he said. Nonetheless, he said, “We’re going to reopen. It’s not a choice.” Just as he held a fundraising concert for a friend who lost her home in the Paradise fire, he hopes others will come to his aid. Disaster has struck too many times in Sonoma County. In 2017, Santa Rosa experienced what at the time was the most destructive wildfire in California history until the Camp Fire in November wiped out the entire town of Paradise, displacing most of its 26,000 residents. One of them, Jen Godfrey, had just relocated to Guerneville after her home near Paradise was damaged by the fire. Her rental in Guerneville was spared by the flood, but she still felt uneasy. “I’m just feeling heavy because this is another form of disaster I’m looking at,” she said. “I see people, their houses aren’t burned down, but it’s still so depressing and still so raw. I’m getting post traumatic stress with the helicopters.” For this county, officials fear disasters like these will become more common. “In many ways we are ground zero for the impacts of climate change,” Sonoma County Supervisor Lynda Hopkins said Thursday. “When you look at the  modeling in our area ... we are going to be experiencing more severe fire seasons and more severe weather.” After the record breaking flood of 1986 and the floods that followed in the 1990s, “We have been known as the most expensive disaster area west of the Mississippi,” she said. Much of that federal money went to elevate homes like Wilson’s in Drake Estates. Like many locals, Richard Lindsay hopped in his kayak on Thursday to survey the damage in town. After the floods in the 1990s, he worked in construction in town, elevating about 300 homes and a couple of businesses, pouring concrete slabs and framing pressure treated walls for new first stories. When he finally bought his own place, “I knew where exactly to buy when it came to the flood. My house is up along the very top of the hill the water would have to reach 255 feet flood stage to reach my house.” Jenny Zapp and her husband, Branon, also were careful where they purchased a house. They were both raised in Guerneville and were 8 or 9 years old when their homes were destroyed by floodwaters. Like the majority of homes in town thanks in part to FEMA funds their house is elevated, with only the garage and storage supposed to be downstairs. “We are not supposed to use it because of floods, and most insurance policies cover structural but not content,” she said. But, she admits, “We can get comfortable and use that space and fill it with things and this happens.” Christmas decorations, their children’s artwork and papers and her husband’s plumbing tools all were covered in muck Thursday. “You don’t really realize how much stuff you have down there,” she said. “It’s a mess and smells bad.” She and Wilson, her neighbor, both enjoyed the bonfire when the river was cresting Wednesday. “We love the river, and we all knew the situation when we moved here,” Wilson said. “We were in good spirits, happy to be together. And we knew we would help each other when the water subsides.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters\n",

      "An “unprecedented” flood season lies ahead this spring, according to NOAA. Rivers continue to rise in several Midwestern states as snow from the “bomb cyclone” melts and new rainstorms bring more precipitation on an already soaked region. Major river flooding will continue across parts of the Mississippi and Missouri River Basins. The combination of snow melt and additional rainfall will lead to rising rivers in some locations this week. For the latest river flood forecasts visit: https://t.co/YcNxqcIZPK pic.twitter.com/waZmlnLJfk The flooding, which began over a week ago, has killed at least three people and caused at least $3 billion in damages so far. Rising water levels have breached levees along the Missouri River and forced several towns to evacuate. In southern Minnesota, flood impacts spread over the weekend, according to MPR News.  Some residents of South Dakota on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation were stranded for two weeks as already poor roads were blocked by floodwaters. “This is going to have a devastating effect on us, I feel,” Oglala Sioux tribe President Julian Bear Runner told Greenwire. “The tribe is utilizing any and all of its resources to try to help the communities that have been impacted.” In Nebraska alone, the flooding has already caused more than $1 billion in damages, with more than 2,000 homes and 340 businesses lost.  More rainfall is expected in the region later this week.  None of this is supposed to be under water.Here what the Missouri River looks like just across from Nebraska City into Iowa. If you ever drive to Kansas City, you're probably familiar with this interchange of I 29 and Highway 2. The Missouri looks like an ocean.#NSP575 pic.twitter.com/kwkkAs5fha On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s spring outlook reported that the situation for the central US is soon going to get much, much worse. “The extensive flooding we’ve seen in the past two weeks will continue through May and become more dire and may be exacerbated in the coming weeks as the water flows downstream,” said Ed Clark, director of NOAA’s National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in a statement. “This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.” Waterways including the Mississippi River and the Red River of the North are already soaked with precipitation levels that are 200 percent above normal. Alongside rapid snowmelt, heavy spring rains and ice jams have led to a massive, destructive rise in water levels. “It is possible that many parts of the Mississippi River will remain above flood stage ... into the first part of the summer in the slow moving natural disaster,” AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski told USA Today. More frequent and severe flooding resulting from massive rainfall is one of the more devastating consequences of climate change. As average temperatures rise, air warms and holds on to more moisture, roughly 7 percent more water for every degree Celsius increase. We’ve already seen the amount of rain dished out from major storms increase over the past century.  The past five years were also the hottest on record. And as an El Niño weather pattern takes hold, forecasters think that 2019 could become the hottest year ever. So keep an umbrella close by.     Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

      "News News |   Editor’s note: Sally Webster and her husband raised Beryl the Brahman  as a member of their family. The “bovine celebrity” has made television appearances and has a large following on Facebook; this was taken from a recent post.  “Initially, I wasn’t sure if I could post this; but I feel it is our duty, as custodians of this great land, to share, educate and bring to life what has happened and is happening right now in North West Queensland, Australia.  And this is a HUGE part of Beryl’s amazing story, still now, surviving, against all odds.....  On the 29th of January, our prayers were answered and the horrendous prolonged drought of 2018  was broken.  Rejoice! 80 mm of pure gold rain water fell from the sky. However, our sheer delight soon faded to worry and finally absolute heartbreak and devastation as over the next 11 days; over 32 inches of rain fell over our great and amazing property. This total is above our ANNUAL rainfall – and we got that in just 11 days.  The elements were against us. Constant rain, howling winds and cold, cold weather saw our livelihoods, pets, mates and “family members” start to die due to exposure. And not only that, record breaking floods have swept across our great region, killing literally hundreds of thousands of cattle. Horses, sheep, goats also included. But also wiping out kangaroos, emus, lizards and all kinds of native animals.  It is said that over 800 properties have been affected. An area of land twice the size of Tasmania, and, the size of France – has been covered by flood waters.  This is a complete and utter national disaster. A leading Australian Industry has been king hit!! And we need to get what’s happening out there – out across Australia and out to our friends across the pond.  Please know also that there was literally nothing anyone could do. Higher ground you say? Where would we have taken them? Mt. Everest? Put them in shelter you say – how do you fit 4,000 5,000 head in a shed? We couldn’t even GET to these animals to move them.  We are so passionate about where we live, what we do and our communities – and if we could have done something – we would have.  Our property alone has lost 90 percent + of the cattle that were living on this property, we had nearly 4,000 here. To put into perspective, that is our next 2 3 years income completely gone. And we are some of the luckier ones. Our houses never went under and we managed to save our horses in time.  So back to Beryl. She has been living in a paddock for about 12 months now away from our homestead. It was important to us to let her be with other cows and also, to have a little baby of her own.  The rains started and we weren’t too worried. But as the days kept on with the conditions and we could see that around our house, weaners were “dropping like flies”  We were getting desperately worried about Beryl and her fate.  The rain eased and there was a break in the weather so Jake ploughed out to her paddock. We were pacing anxiously around the two way to hear of any news. “I found Lilly” was the first call. Lilly is my niece’s poddy calf, similar in age to Beryl. I was beside myself.  Nearly an hour passed and we heard “I’ve found Beryl – she’s been living by herself out the back of this ridge eating prickle bush.”  We realize, finding two Brahmans amongst 4,000 is no great win. But boy, oh, boy it was good for the soul. And as the tears flowed Jake bought them home and finally we had them safely with us. And a whole lotta nice was put into our hearts for the day.  The timing was so lucky – the weather didn’t break for another two days – it was so cold – and I can guarantee if Jake didn’t go and get her – she wouldn’t have survived.  So now she hasn’t left the house. She’s back on her blanket and back into Sayos and Jatz crackers. And I am happy my little love is home.  But my heart is heavy. Heavy for my family, heavy for my friends and heavy for our community.  Flood waters are dropping but this is nowhere near being over.  Dead animals are literally, at every direction we look.  My husband and my brother in law have been hectically trying to get hay to animals that have survived but have not eaten in literally 10 days besides a few prickly thorns off an old prickly bush.  Every single person for hundreds of kilometers is doing the exact same thing. Fighting for our animals, our livelihoods and, fighting for the ability for AUSTRALIA and the WORLD to see what is happening right here, right now. And fighting for you, to help us!  To the amazing and resilient people of NW Queensland. I have no words but a whole lotta love and a rum when all of this is over.  To the local councils you guys have done an amazing job. To all the angels of the sky, the helicopter pilots, words are not enough. The army has also done an amazing job helping to get fodder out to places cut off from everywhere. But the locals – the local people have been and are amazing. They are living this nightmare themselves – but still helping each other.  And there is still fences to mend, turkey nests, dams, pipelines, troughs to fix......the next 12 months is going to be really tough. And that’s an understatement.  So as you go to bed, or as you wake. Hold your family a little tighter, feed your pets a little extra, smile at a complete stranger. Life could be so much worse.  And please, if you can, give a little to a place that has always, given a lot.  And please, buy Australian beef!  Currently our land is quiet and bare. Once a bustling area of cattle and the other Australian animals moving about, seeking out food and water, there are now areas without birds, without ground animals, kangaroos, cows and many other ground dwelling animals. Nothing. No noise. It’s very apocalyptic. The eerie sound of death. It’s devastating. The Australian Outback is a land of severe extremes. Graziers  have suffered through seven years of extreme drought, most regions receiving less than half the normal amount of moisture. The stockmen have been spending every dime they had to purchase feed. Many graziers have sold the majority of their stock, holding onto small choice breeding groups in hopes of being able to rebuild their herds once the rains came. But once the rain, that has been so desperately needed came, it was hard and fast. Northwest Queensland saw two years’ worth of rain in under two weeks’ time, receiving 30 to 42 inches of rain. It started Jan. 27 and finally cleared Feb. 8. On Feb. 9 experts estimated that more than 7,722 square miles  were underwater and the flood at its widest point was over 46 miles across, stretching across the Flinders River drainage. The main zone that suffered high volumes of cattle death loss is about half the size of South Dakota. The unprecedented monsoon trough was accompanied by sustained winds of over 40 mph. Australia is in late summer with temperatures still soaring to over 100 degrees F, with places even reaching over 110 degrees. The storm brought unseasonably low temperatures, down into the 60s accompanied by winds over 45 mph. The cattle are tropical breeds, mainly Brahman, with short hair and thin hides to help let the heat out. The wet and cold cattle huddled for warmth and then eventually died from exposure by the thousands. The ones in the flood zone sought high ground, but most drowned. Live cattle found after the flood had lost half their body weight and many were too weak to stand. The death toll is of a magnitude almost hard to fathom; close to 800 properties are estimating losses of 50 to 100 percent of their herds. Currently the numbers are guessed at between 300,000 to 500,000 head of dead cattle. The zone of cattle deaths is roughly five times larger than that covered by the water. This is being called the worst flood ever in Australian history. “ Unimaginable and never seen before. The flat country is all still under water and will be for many more weeks yet. The only way in and out is by chopper.” At this point in time we have no idea what we will do. Apart from doing the emergency tasks with choppers around the four properties, we aren’t yet able to get around in any vehicles to really see what we are dealing with in the way of repairs. Once we can see this then we can access where we are at. At this stage we are assuming from the air, that our estimate is around 50 percent of our entire herd of cattle has perished in the storm. Our priority now is to dispose of the thousands of dead cattle in the paddocks which over an area of 120,000 acres is a formidable task. They are currently scattered like someone has thrown rice over an area of land, with the occasional clump of bodies in piles. The Gispy Brahman Stud, the Curley family’s cattle station north of Cloncurry, Queensland, produces Brahman bulls to sell for breeding purposes. They had only recently turned the bulls out for the breeding season, so the bulls were in peak condition, having a head start going into the storm and fared better than most. Cows were still calving, and most of those died. Their weaned calves from the previous year died as well.  ASSESSING  THE DAMAGE Due to the boggy, gumbo like nature of the ground, the graziers were unable to get around during the storm, the small helicopters they use for gathering cattle and checking the land cannot fly in rain. That is still the main mode of transportation in many areas after this rain event. Once the rain started it never stopped, so the graziers were unable to reach or move their stock. Droughts come on slow and can be coped with, but the flooding came on overnight. The graziers are facing the instant loss of good, healthy stock and were powerless to prevent the tragedy. But the nightmare is far from over. “Shortly we will be facing potential disease in our groundwater from all of the dead cattle lying around. We will have to be incredibly proactive to ensure that this won’t happen. We have limited resources on the ground in the way of human help at the moment, mostly due to not being able to get into the stations as they are still very wet, but we are incredibly grateful for the family and friends that are here now doing their very best to help in this crisis. We could really do with a lot more support to help us all face what the devastation will be, and to help clean up the bodies of cattle and other wildlife that will be in the thousands. Our daily tasks have gone by the wayside as we are tending to many other more urgent issues, so we would love to call out anyone that can lend a hand to us and the many other stations facing this devastation. We really can’t stress enough that we need people power presently to help us through these tasks. The people of Australia have offered so many well wishes and their support and we wish that we could be in touch with everyone, but it’s simply not possible at this stage. We would like to say to you all thank you and it means the world to us. It’s very warming to have the Australian and international people come behind us. Saying this, we really need the Australian government and the banks to collectively come together to help us through this horrible devastation. I had an interview with the ABC national Australia breakfast show to discuss what we thought would be advantageous. We presented that we would need four years of suspended interest and mortgage payments to allow us to rebuild and then we could look at business as usual. Most people we know have lost more than half of their herd and we will need to have help of this kind. If not, we will be potentially looking at an industry that will be wiped out as we know it. I’m not sure if many people outside of our industry understand that insurance isn’t an option for many people when they have cattle. So for many it’s game over. That’s devastating. The Australian Agricultural Company is a world leading producer of beef and agricultural products and Australia’s largest beef producer. The company has 21 properties, four of which have been some of the hardest hit by the flooding. According to a Feb. 11 press release from the company, “Our immediate focus is on our people, the welfare of our animals and the tight knit communities in which we operate. The full effects of the flood are being managed and measured in real time.”  HIT HARD Their Wondoola station has been the hardest hit with the herd of 30,000 composite cows and calves sustaining extreme losses and even the headquarters being underwater. Their other herds in the region are also suffering significant death loss. The AACO is Australia’s only listed beef stock company, and since news of the disaster, shares have taken a sharp drop. The company had spent $500,000 building earth mounds for the cattle to shelter on in case of floods, but with water up to rooftops and even two story homes submerged, the mounds couldn’t save the cattle. Some of the victims have been posting photos and information on social media, with Jacqueline Curley’s photo album going viral across the globe. But a great many of them are still too heartbroken to voice their pain and have even stopped answering the phone. They are spending days lifting cattle out of bogs and digging through piles of dead for possible survivors, feeding and doctoring them only to be forced to shoot them when it’s obvious they won’t survive. Stockmen and pilots come back to headquarters begging for more bullets as they carry out the devastating task of humanely putting animals, including horses and pets, out of their misery. One family’s homestead is two stories high and both levels are underwater. They were choppered out and he was forced to make the choice to shoot his working dogs, their horses and his children’s ponies so they wouldn’t suffer any longer trying to swim in the deep water. These people are now facing the daunting task of burying their livelihoods. Some are able to reach the carcasses but others can’t get the equipment in because of the boggy ground. On top of everything else, the weather has turned hot again. They are in danger of sickness and disease as the rotting bodies contaminate groundwater, all while risking infection from working every day in the mud and battling the insects. The grass will flourish in some areas, while others have had such massive erosion the land will take months and years to heal, especially where there is water standing. Many graziers have no money to rebuild and no hope for any kind of an income for years. The cattle they were fattening to sell are dead or shrunk to shadows. The drought stricken Outback already had one of the highest suicide rates in the world and many fear this flood will be the breaking point for countless more. The Royal Flying Doctors are sending in extra doctors and the government has set aside money for mental health support, but with the stigma attached to mental health issues, few are expected to seek help. The bush chopper pilots work tirelessly hauling hay and supplies, giving a glimmer of hope to those sinking in despair as they deliver feed and fuel to those cut off from the outside world. They are the region’s first responders. Hay is dropped from helicopters to cattle stranded on high ground, hoping to keep them alive until they can be rescued. “The rain stopped here over a week ago. Our water is dropping, the properties north of here still have river heights of over 62 feet and one river is still nearly 50 miles wide. Unimaginable and never seen before. The flat country is all still under water and will be for many more weeks yet. The only way in and out is by chopper,” said Jennifer Hetherington, Livestock Agent employee in Cloncurry, Queensland. Many of her clients are victims of the flood. “We are seeing pictures of station owners wading through mud trying to save their cattle or rounding up horses on jet skis. Chopper pilots  are delivering feed and fuel off their backs. Politicians are flying around in planes full of media for ubiquitous photo opportunities. Where is all the help?” Hetherington said. Infrastructure of all kinds is gone or damaged: fences, tanks, roads, bridges, and in some cases the homes were also flooded. Due to the railroad tracks being wrecked and most of the outside roads damaged, the stations and surrounding towns are cut off from much of the desperately needed supplies. The damaged roads are hampering the delivery of donated hay and supplies. In places the floodwater has reached to the power lines. The flood waters are just now reaching the coast, so the water is still rising for some and carrying with it carcasses and filth from upstream as the river drains into the Gulf of Carpentaria. The eastern part of Queensland has also been inundated; the coastal town of Townsville is largely underwater due to almost 6 feet of rain. The sparsely populated flooded western regions have received little media coverage, something the locals find infuriating. While northwest Queensland is underwater, southern Queensland is still in the grip of one of the worst droughts in history. They are facing a heatwave and bush fires in the middle of Australia, but the south has had snow in the forecast. Friends, neighbors and even those with no contacts are volunteering their time and collecting donations. Hay and personal donations along with money are being collected and distributed to those most desperately in need. ❖ Start a dialogue, stay on topic and be civil.

      "By Giselda Vagnoni 3 Min Read ROME    Flood tides in Venice hit their highest level in more than 50 years this week, inundating parts of the lagoon city under almost two meters of water and raising fears of irreparable damage to historic treasures including Saint Mark’s Basilica. The phenomenon of floods, “acqua alta” in Italian, is caused by a combination of factors, exacerbated by climate change    from rising sea levels and unusually high tides to land subsidence that has caused the ground level of the city to sink. It has been accelerating markedly in recent decades. This week, the Byzantine Saint Mark’s Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years    but the fourth in the last 20. Construction began on a sea defense system in 2003 but, after prolonged delays, it is not expected to begin operating until the end of 2021. Here are some of the factors behind the flooding: The sea level around Venice has been rising steadily for decades, a phenomenon which has been accelerated by climate change. The mean sea level is now estimated to be more than 20 cm higher than it was a century ago. At the same time, the city’s ground level has been gradually sinking, by an estimated one millimeter a year, owing to the soft and shifting geological terrain on which its foundations are built. That was made worse over decades by local industries around Venice pumping groundwater from the acquifer under the lagoon until they were forbidden to do so in the 1970s. Venice, built on a collection of small islands within a saltwater lagoon off the northeastern coast of Italy, has always lived with tides that usually create variations of around 50 cm in sea levels but which can sometimes be more extreme. Scirocco winds blowing from the south east can drive water into the lagoon, much of which is made up of marshes and mud flats. When high tides coincide with strong winds and a low pressure system, the effect can be unpredictable and extreme. That is what happened on Nov. 12, when winds of over 100 km an hour hit the city and lagoon tides peaked at 187 cm, their highest level since the 1966 record of 194 cm. Venice’s Institute of Marine Sciences said with the effects of climate change, rising sea levels and more frequent storms at sea, such extreme events will become increasingly common.

      "Regional leaders call on Boris Johnson to act as Kent and East Sussex are hit by flooding Boris Johnson must overhaul the system for deciding where flood defence funding is spent and launch an emergency response unit to prevent a repeat of the “catastrophic” damage caused by the November floods, leading politicians have said. Nearly 100 flood warnings were in place across much of England on Sunday, hampering the Christmas getaway, with towns and villages deluged in Kent and East Sussex. Dan Jarvis, the elected mayor of the Sheffield city region, called on the government to establish a “Cobra for the north” that would be chaired by a cabinet minister and kick into action as soon as floods hit the region. He said the prime minister had privately agreed to help convene a dedicated emergency response group to react more quickly to widespread flooding after he was criticised for his slow response to the devastation. Jarvis said the emergency unit should be chaired by Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, and bring together local and national government agencies for a detailed postmortem of the floods that affected more than 4,200 homes across South Yorkshire and hundreds more in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. Simon Greaves, the Labour leader of Bassetlaw council, where nearly 200 homes were badly damaged, said: “It would be a scandal if the government response to this crisis is simply devoted to a mopping up exercise and a grant here and a grant there when actually there are people’s homes that need to be saved from flooding in the future. “There will be a need for multimillion pound investment for flood defences without any doubt if we’re going to avoid a catastrophe of the same scale.” The Environment Agency put 88 flood warnings in place stretching from Middlesbrough down to the south coast on Sunday. There are a further 227 flooding alerts in place, meaning there is a risk of flash flooding and standing water. About 90 properties have been flooded: about 60 in the south east and about 30 in Devon and Cornwall, the agency said. In interviews with the Guardian nearly two months on from the floods, political leaders and officials in many of the worst affected areas said they were dismayed at the government’s slow response to the crisis and that there had been no high level discussion about how it could be prevented in future. Council officials are calculating the cost of the damage but the final bill is expected to run into millions of pounds, with vital infrastructure including roads, bridges and power plants affected when a month’s worth of rain fell in 24 hours in large parts of northern England. Jarvis suggested there were problems with Flood Re, the government backed scheme set up in the aftermath of 2015’s Storm Desmond to provide insurance for domestic properties deemed at significant risk of flooding. “I don’t think this scheme has worked,” he said, suggesting that central government had a “moral duty” to help those unable to get insurance. Jarvis also said he wanted the Environment Agency to carry out a review of what happened in the Don valley, to work out “whether upgrades to flood defences in Sheffield had a knock on effect downstream. People have suggested that was the case but no one knows for certain.” He added: “What I want to know is where do we need to strengthen these defences? Otherwise it will happen again. It will require significant investment, but it is a vital piece of work.” The agency has said an average of £1bn a year will need to be invested in flood defences as well as a wider programme making all infrastructure flood resilient by 2050. The Conservative party pledged in its manifesto to spend £4bn over the next five years on a new flood defence programme, a commitment repeated in the Queen’s speech on 19 December. Greaves called for an overhaul of the system for allocating taxpayers’ money to flood defence schemes, which experts have said favour wealthier areas at the expense of the less well off. To secure funding, a flood prevention scheme has to demonstrate that it delivers more in benefits than it costs to implement and maintain. It does this by calculating the economic losses that would be avoided by protecting property and infrastructure – tilting the system in favour of more expensive property and wealthier areas. Greaves said the system was “rigged against” places such as Worksop in Nottinghamshire, whose entire high street and surrounding homes were deluged when the River Ryton burst its banks last month. He added: “If the status quo is allowed to remain and no intervention is made this will happen again. This crisis cannot be forgotten.” Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley council, said ministers needed to draw up an action plan that would provide long term support to flood threatened regions before the next deluge. He said there needed to be a review of whether agricultural practices upstream, such as the burning of heather moorland and removal of peat, were causing rainwater to rush downstream and rivers to burst their banks in residential areas. Nearly 200 properties were affected by flooding in Barnsley last month, 164 of which were residential. It was the third time in 12 years that flood water has swept through the borough. He said: “We’ve had three serious floods in the last 12 years – it’s not a one off. It’s going to happen again.” A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Recent flooding in Yorkshire had terrible consequences for people and businesses. This is why we are investing record amounts to help protect communities across the nation from the threat of flooding, using both natural flood management techniques and traditional defences. “We spend money where it is needed most – with similar funding heading to high risk areas across both the north and south of England.”\n",

      "Incessant rainfall since 11 July afternoon there has killed 29 people and displaced 2,065 households in Central and Eastern part of the country. Recorded highest rainfall for 24 hrs  was 311.9 mm at Simara, Bara, and 245 mm was recorded in Janakpur. The communications systems are semi functioning in the worst affected areas...The most affected districts are Sarlahi, Mahottari and Rautahat...While the weather situation is improving in the Kathmandu valley, the authorities have issued warning alerts to residents along the Kankai, Koshi, Tamor, Bagmati, Kamala, East Rapti watersheds in Provinces 1, 2 and 3.       Incessant rainfall since 11 July afternoon has killed 64 people and temporarily displaced 16,520 households to date  in Central and Eastern Nepal. While there are humanitarian needs, this is a localized situation, smaller in scale than 2017 when around 460,000 were temporarily displaced...The communications systems and electricity are semi functioning in the worst affected areas ...While the weather situation is improving, and the flood water levels are receding, the authorities have issued warning alerts to people in Provinces 5, 6 and 7 as heavy rain is expected in those areasin the coming days.         Relief efforts are ongoing, and the situation is progressively returning to normal. The temporarily displaced population is gradually returning: According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the number of temporarily displaced has decreased to 11,839 households from a peak of 17, 431 on 16 July. Flood waters have receded in most areas, and following repair works major highways are operational. However, rural roads in some area of the southern parts of Terai districts remain inaccessible, and water logging and associated damages in some locations in the southern part of Saptari, Rautahat and Mahottari continue to pose operational challenges. The axis of this monsoon trough has moved south, away from the Terai region of Nepal. Thus, the monsoon rainfall is less active across the country overall, although the authorities have asked Provinces 5, 6 and 7 to be on standby and issued alerts to major watersheds in those areas, according to the forecast.  According to the National Emergency Operation Centre  as of 19 July, 90 people died, 29 are still missing and 41 have been reported injured as a result of ongoing heavy Monsoon rains. The Nepal Ministry of Home Affairs  and Nepal Survey Department report that 11,839 are displaced. In the last 7 days, 92 landslides and 83 floods have affected the country.  Heavy rainfall on 11 12 July caused landslides and flooding in 32 Districts across Nepal. Flooding was most severe in 11 Terai districts of Provinces 1 and 2. A large loss of life and damages to assets, housing, water and sanitation infrastructure, food stocks, crop and livestock all have a significant impact on food security in the region. An estimated 212,000 people’s food security is significantly affected as a result of the flooding, of which 101,600 people, or 17,400 households, are deemed to be the most in need of assistance.  As of 24 July, media report 94 fatalities, while 29 people are reported missing. The death toll could further increase after several landslides hit Gulmi district . Various highways and main roads closed due to floods and landslides triggered by heavy rainfall. Rivers Bagmati  and Riukhola  have reached above danger level.  As of 29 July, 115 people have been confirmed dead, 29 people are reported as missing and 69 have been injured. For the next 24 hours, widespread heavy rain with thunderstorms is forecast over the country.  As of 30 July, an estimated 176,800 people’s food security is currently significantly affected as a result of the flooding, of which 79,900 people, or 13,800 households, are deemed to be the most in need of assistance. At least 12,000 households are estimated displaced in six Districts as of 29 July, a majority of whom are in Siraha  and Mahottari  Districts. Many households in flooded areas have lost food stock from the winter harvest. Within the most affected communities of each district, losses were largest in Siraha, Rautahat, Sarlahi and Mahottari, with 40 80% of households having lost upwards of 75% of their food stock.  As of 1 August, 117 people died, 80 have been injured and 38 are reportedly still missing. The number of fatalities has increased following several floods and landslides across 32 Districts since the beginning of July. For the next 24 hours, moderate to heavy rain with thunderstorms is forecast across the country. Furthermore, several houses have been damaged and destroyed, particularly in Rautahat, Mahottari and Siraha Districts.

      " IranTehran/Geneva, 15 April 2019 – An estimated 2 million people – one in every 40 people in Iran – need humanitarian assistance as a result of the massive floods that have swept across the country. Heavy rains and flash floods have affected more than 2,000 cities and towns across almost all of Iran’s 31 provinces, according to the Iranian Red Crescent. An estimated 10 million people have been affected in some way, including more than half a million have been displaced from their homes – some permanently. At least 78 people have been killed and more than 1,136 injured. Zahra Falahat, the Iranian Red Crescent’s Under Secretary General for International Affairs and International Humanitarian Law said: “This is the largest disaster to hit Iran in more than 15 years. The scenes that our volunteers are reporting are devastating – entire villages washed away in a matter of minutes, countless homes and buildings damaged and completely destroyed. “For the Red Crescent, this is one of the largest humanitarian relief efforts in our history. We are making every single resource we have available to save and support people. But it is not enough.” More than 18,000 Red Crescent relief workers – most of them volunteers – have been involved in the humanitarian response. Seventeen Red Crescent helicopters along with 41 boats have been used to rescue people trapped by rising waters. In all, more than 457,000 people have been reached with Red Crescent services, including about 239,000 people who have been provided with temporary shelters. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  has launched an international emergency appeal seeking 5.1 million Swiss francs to expand Red Crescent support to an additional 30,000 families . The IFRC supported part of the operation will focus on providing unconditional cash grants to each of these families. The operation also seeks to replenish some of the emergency stocks that the Red Crescent has used so far to ensure that it can continue to respond quickly to emergency needs throughout the country. The Iranian Red Crescent has been emptying its warehouses in response to this operation, distributing vast numbers of tents, blankets, plastic sheets and other emergency commodities, as well as providing tons of food stuffs. With further rains forecast in the coming days, it is feared that the impact of this disaster could continue to grow. Sayed Hashem, IFRC’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, is in Iran to support local response efforts. He said: “The needs caused by this disaster are very real, and the response of the Red Crescent and other local actors has been remarkable. But this emergency is so severe that international support is absolutely needed. We urge our partners around the world to support our appeal.” Media contacts In Tehran: Iranian Red Crescent: Mansooreh Bagheri, +989121396432, intdep@rcs.ir IFRC: Rana Sidani Cassou, + 961 71 802 779, +989396280477  rana.cassou@ifrc.org In Geneva: Matthew Cochrane, +41 79 251 80 39, matthew.cochrane@ifrc.org Related content Read more about IFRC’s emergency appeal for Iran.\n",

      "Before you read this story, take a minute to stop and look around you. Now imagine your surroundings under two feet of dirty, sewage filled water. If you’re at home, everything is trashed. Never mind your car, your furniture, or washing machine. They will be ruined, but those things can be replaced. Think of your wedding album, soaked and spoiled. The music box your grandmother gave you, full of stinking mud. That is the reality of being flooded. And sadly, it’s a reality that many people in the UK—in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire—have faced in the recent floods. Tragically, floodwater can also be life threatening. Given the huge costs to people and property when it floods, it’s a reasonable question to ask why, in one of the richest countries in the world, more cannot be done to prevent flooding. And if not prevent it, to know more precisely when and where it will hit. As a hydrologist and a flood and hazard forecaster, I spend my life doing just that. And despite the work of some of the brightest scientists, the world’s most advanced supercomputers and the commitment of hardworking people on the ground, floods are just difficult beasts to pin down. And if you’ve ever thought that your home could never be affected, you should know that floods can happen almost anywhere, at any time. Some of the most wonderful aspects of the UK—the changeable weather and spectacular landscape—are also what makes the country so susceptible to flooding. When beautiful river valleys and low lying plains—as well as cities and urban areas—are inundated with persistent rain, sudden downpours or high tides with storms, flooding can quickly follow. Especially if there is an unexpected fault in the infrastructure designed to hold back water or prevent flooding, as was seen at Whaley Bridge in Yorkshire in August 2019. In Doncaster in early November, only a slight variation in a fairly typical weather system was enough to cause flooding. Cold and warm air masses regularly press against each other close to North America, creating an Atlantic storm factory. These weather systems are often fired towards Europe too by the strength and direction of the jet stream. Damp ground in the north of England is also par for the course. But add one heavy downpour, caused by a rotating weather front getting “stuck” over one area—and you have a flood. Weather predictions have come a long way in the past few decades—today’s three day forecast is as accurate as a 24 hour forecast was in the 1990s. But they are never perfect. Multiply all the uncertainty within the weather forecast with all the complexity of modeling the path of water traveling through the landscape—both above and below ground—then you start to get an idea of the difficulties forecasters face. We have to take account of all the different routes through the landscape that a single raindrop might take. There are billions upon billions of different possibilities. It requires lots of assumptions. So much for looking into the future. What about learning from the past? Many people in flood hit areas have said that the floods are unprecedented. Older residents have said they have never seen anything like it. But we must remember our landscape is thousands—even millions—of years old. We need to think about much longer timescales than single human lifespans. And of course on top of this, the landscape and climate are changing—so even the best historic data don’t provide a good proxy of the future. Fishlake may not have flooded in recent years, but it is right on the floodplain of the River Don. Its watery name is probably no coincidence. Neither is that of Meadowhall, the shopping center in Sheffield, more than likely built on a flood meadow. On November 8, it was marooned. But people tend to like living by the river—and they don’t associate a beautiful riverside development with dirty water and destroyed wedding photos. Flooding is hard to predict and prepare for. But floods happen. They always have—and we know that as the global climate warms due to human activity we are likely to see more of some types of flood in Britain. It’s hard to convince people who don’t know they are at risk that they should prepare for the worst. This is where the government must step in. To better prepare for floods, we need difficult, expensive, but rational decision making on flood defences. That would mean seriously considering the risk of building homes and businesses in the floodplain, and planning away from these areas as much as possible. If there is no other option, then the flood proof design standards must be substantially higher. Developers must also be held to account for ensuring these standards are met and householders must be made fully aware of the risks. Forecasts and communications of flood risks can always be improved, and my colleagues and I will be working hard on it for years to come. But residents, farmers and businesses can’t be expected to face off the problem of floods on their own. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "Houston area schools were closed Friday, utilities scrambled to remedy 37,000 power outages, and suburban police captured a 5 foot alligator swimming in a puddle after a torrential storm pummeled the area with rain and hail Thursday night. The National Weather Service issued flood warnings for several areas Friday morning, and a flash flood watch remains in place throughout Southeast Texas until 7 a.m. Saturday. Houston and Galveston will potentially experience thunderstorms and heavy rain Friday night and into Saturday, before drier conditions set in Sunday. Radar update at 11:24 AM:  It looks like much less coverage this afternoon as the airmass has stabilized. Next best rain chances possibly coming late tonight through tomorrow morning. Keep updated with the latest forecasts. #txwx #houwx #glswx #bcswx pic.twitter.com/UPkVlRRmFb According to KTRK, there were no official reports of injuries due to the storm as of early Friday. The University of Houston was closed on Friday and announced that its commencement ceremonies would be postponed until the following week. In a week that has already seen Houston and surrounding areas in Southeast Texas face some of the most severe rainfall since Hurricane Harvey, heavy storms again pounded the city late Thursday, leaving at least three bayous flowing over the top of their banks and dozens reportedly trapped for a time in floodwater on Interstate 10. The Thursday night storm continued a week of flooding in a city where the fallout from the historic 2017 hurricane is still being felt. Harris County meteorologist Jeff Lindner told the Houston Chronicle that more than three inches fell in most areas of Houston, but one area far east of Houston got four inches in 30 minutes. Some areas expected to see up to six inches of rain, the Chronicle reported. Earlier in the week, the city faced as much as six to 10 inches of rain in just a few hours. As The Washington Post’s Ian Livingston reported, at least one location in Houston saw water rise higher than it did during Harvey. A torrent flooded areas near Houston Tuesday. More excessive rain is forecast through Saturday. On local media, videos of trapped, submerged and stranded cars were broadcast deep into the night. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told reporters around midnight of reports of “about 30 or 40 people stranded at I 10 and Wayside,” located on the east side of the city. The Houston Police Department said it sent a high water rescue vehicle to help. “They’re doing evacuations, mostly street level evacuations,” Acevedo told reporters. “The fire department has been out all night. They’re going to continue to be out all night.” HPD is sending a high water rescue vehicle to East Interstate Highway 10 at Wayside.  We have reports about 40 people are trapped by flood waters.  #houwx This is where Houston Police says 40 people may be trapped in floodwater on the freeway.  I 10 at Wayside. #khou #HTownRush https://t.co/tVFmPRc1oI pic.twitter.com/CXlt8J6aS3 Later in the night, Acevedo announced that ramps to major highways had been closed and urged people to stay off the roads. “Please el not drive unless it is absolutely necessary and SLOW DOWN!!” he tweeted. CenterPoint Energy, the Houston utility provider, tweeted that crews were working to restore power, but as of early Friday, there were more than 85,000 outages. Travelers at Houston’s two airports faced widespread cancellations. Southwest Airlines nixed about 70 arriving and departing flights into Houston’s Hobby Airport on Thursday night, as well as another 29 more on Friday, according to KHOU. A ground stop at Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport was in effect until past midnight, leaving many displaced travelers scrambling for lodging and transportation.

In Friendswood, a mansion that was once an event venue known as the White House Ranch was engulfed in flames amid the downpour. As KTRK reported, it’s unclear whether the fire was weather related, but the scene at the $2.6 million home soon became one of the more jarring visuals to come from the Thursday storm. No injuries were reported, and everyone inside the home evacuated, Battalion Chief Mark Faber told KTRK. “It’s such a tough fire because we could not put our ladder trucks up because of the lightning,” he said. “I would imagine, yeah, they are pretty distraught that they’re watching their house being destroyed by fire.” Massive fire underway at this home in Friendswood. We’ve literally watched the home burn down slowly. So sad. Hoping everyone made it out ok! @abc13houston pic.twitter.com/0Q8bEFGy0T Near the University of Houston, one woman who said she was graduating Friday pleaded for help on Twitter. “My car is stuck and cars are drowning,” she wrote. She added: “Legit crying in my car because I don’t even know if I’m graduating tomorrow morning.” She would eventually make it to higher ground to wait out the flood before heading back to the university. The University of Houston postponed its commencement ceremonies Friday. Stephen King, a musician from Kingwood, a suburb northeast of downtown Houston that’s been among the hardest hit during this week’s deluge, detailed a chaotic scene of flooding, “topped off by the loudest thunderclap i’ve ever heard.” “this is really genuinely scary,” King tweeted. He added: “keep kingwood texas  in your thoughts please.” this is really genuinely scary. fire trucks driving around aimlessly after they can’t find the fire they got a call for, streets starting to flood, and topped off by the loudest thunderclap i’ve ever heard.keep kingwood texas  in your thoughts please pic.twitter.com/wUPkR8k0Kv About 20 miles south, Rubi Soto, an advertising professional, found herself thankful that her spouse upgraded his truck. “This is why I say sure babe get that lift and bigger tires on your truck,” she tweeted. This is why I say sure babe get that lift and bigger tires on your truck. 59 & Hopper area. #houstonflood #houstonweather pic.twitter.com/nmiPSXVYGX The storm even found its way inside Minute Maid Park, where the Houston Astros were hosting the Texas Rangers. Earlier on Thursday, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner  advised those not in proximity to the ballpark to reconsider going to the game, the Chronicle reported. “Today is maybe a day to have a happy hour at home,” he said. But thousands of Astros fans did not adhere to the mayor’s warning, instead partaking in a 4 2 win. Even with a retractable roof, some of them wound up wet when rain made its way into at least one section in right field. “There’s no escape!” Astros fan Corinne Villa wrote in her Instagram video. “It’s raining inside @minute_maid_park and of course its just in my section.”  Theres no escape!

      "Williamstown, Ky. – In the Bible, the ark survived an epic flood. Yet the owners of Kentucky’s Noah’s ark attraction are demanding their insurance company bail them out after flooding caused nearly $1 million in property damage. The Ark Encounter says in a federal lawsuit that heavy rains in 2017 and 2018 caused a landslide on its access road. The Courier Journal reports the attraction’s insurance carriers refused to cover the damage. The 510 foot long wooden ark has been a popular northern Kentucky attraction since its 2016 opening.

      " Hamburg residents held back the Missouri River in 2011, then had to take down the makeshift levee that saved them. Much of the town is now under water. Flooding in Hamburg, Iowa, turned streets into canals.Credit...Hilary Swift for The New York Times Supported by By Mitch Smith HAMBURG, Iowa A makeshift levee had once saved the town of Hamburg from floodwaters, and so residents began a desperate fight to keep it. They lobbied politicians. They sought donations. They even danced for the cause, along Main Street. “Levee, levee, save us from the river,” they sang in a YouTube video seven years ago. But money needed to fix up the levee never came, and, by Wednesday, the town, including much of Main Street, was underwater. In Hamburg, home to about 1,100 people, the swollen Missouri River invaded houses, swamped the farm equipment dealership and even reached the flagpole in the center of town. It covered diesel tanks and corrupted the drinking water plant. It turned streets into canals. “All you can see is roofs,” said Josh Hayes, who works in Hamburg and took a boat through the flooded part of town. Already, people were talking about what Hamburg might look like once the water receded. Would homes be salvageable? How many businesses and neighbors might leave? Would people donate to help rebuild? And most of all, would federal help come this time to save Hamburg from future floods? “This will happen again if they don’t move the town,” said Mike Wells, the school superintendent, whose duties, as flooding swept across the Midwest in recent days, have included running an emergency shelter in his building, helping to evacuate a retirement complex and canoeing through floodwaters to save a missing cat. Low lying parts of town could be relocated onto the hillside, he suggested. Residents of Hamburg, wedged between the Nishnabotna and Missouri Rivers in Iowa’s fertile southwest corner, speak with pride about enduring nature’s whims, about living in a place where people volunteer to fill sandbags and donate meals and make a silly music video about a levee. “We all know, living between two rivers, that something like this can happen,” said Heather Garcia, who has not been able to return to her flooded house since Monday when she fled with her son and dog and pretty much nothing else. “But it’s our home. And we just keep going. I’m not really sure how to explain it.” John Hayes, another resident, was more pessimistic: “I have a gut, bad feeling that this might be the end of this little town.” Riverfront living in Hamburg has seemed more precarious than ever since 2011. That’s where the beloved levee came in. The town had long been protected by an approved levee as high as 18 feet designed to block floodwaters. But when still higher waters were threatening the town in 2011, residents and the United States Army Corps of Engineers topped off the levee with a cobbled together emergency addition: eight or nine more feet of protection. It was just enough to spare the city through the floods that year, and so residents were eager to keep it forever. But the Corps said the improvised addition was not sufficient as it was. It needed to be removed or rebuilt to particular specifications at a cost. When the money could not be found, the levee was cut back to its original size and residents were left gazing nervously toward the riverbank. “We worked a lot with the local sponsors to try to improve them to federal standards, but at the time the funding was just unavailable,” said Lt. Col. James T. Startzell, the deputy commander and chief of staff for the Corps’s Omaha District. Even if the taller levee had remained in place, Colonel Startzell said he believed Hamburg would have still flooded this week. Some in Hamburg said they understood the reasoning, even if it was difficult to accept this week. Others blamed the smaller levee and other federal water policies for the misery they were experiencing. “People are furious,” said Ms. Garcia. The floods in Hamburg came as overflowing rivers wrecked large portions of Nebraska and Iowa over the last week, decimating farmland and wiping out roads. Damage to industry and infrastructure was expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and perhaps much higher. At least three people had died, including one in the same county as Hamburg. “I’m looking at global warming I don’t need to see the graphs,” said Hamburg’s mayor, Cathy Crain, referring to the role of climate change in increasing the frequency of extreme weather events. After two record setting floods in a single decade, Ms. Crain said, “I’m living it and everybody else here is living it.” The flood spoiled a time of cautious optimism in Hamburg, which like many rural Midwestern towns now has about half the population it once did. Next week, Dr. Wells, the school superintendent, was scheduled to ask state officials for permission to reopen the town’s high school, a move seen as crucial to keeping young families in town. Before the water hit, Ms. Crain said, people were talking about building a new subdivision and finding new residents. But as floodwaters receded in other places, Hamburg remained largely submerged on Wednesday. On the dry side of town, residents visited the school to pick up hot meals and donated clothes that filled the gym. Ms. Crain, who was operating from a makeshift City Hall in the school’s home economics classroom, spoke hopefully about getting businesses back open, even as she coordinated more immediate concerns like hot showers and restoring gas service. “We had certainly our horrible moments we’re not through with that yet,” Ms. Crain said. “Today, we’re up and we are saying there’s going to be a future.” She said she was hopeful once again for another project too: a higher levee.

      "The Boston Globe/Getty Images When a steel tank full of molasses ruptured in 1919, physics and neglect contributed to make the accident so horrific, leading to 21 deaths. It was like a perfect—if bizarre, terrifying and very sticky—storm.  Around lunchtime on the afternoon of January 15, 1919, a giant tank of molasses burst open in Boston’s North End. More than two million gallons of thick liquid poured out like a tsunami wave, reaching speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. The molasses flooded streets, crushed buildings and trapped horses in an event that ultimately killed 21 people and injured 150 more. The smell of molasses lingered for decades. LISTEN NOW: What happened this week in history? Find out on the brand new podcast, HISTORY This Week. Episode 2: The Great Boston Molasses Flood One hundred years later, analyses have pinpointed a handful of factors that combined to make the disaster so disastrous. Among them: flawed steel, safety oversights, fluctuating air temperatures and the principles of fluid dynamics. Results were devastating.  “First you kind of laugh at it, then you read about it, and it was just horrible,” says Mark Rossow, a civil engineer and professor emeritus at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, who has written about the molasses flood. READ MORE: The Great Molasses Flood of 1919 In the immediate aftermath, news coverage included speculation about fermentation that produced too much pressure inside the tank. Some blamed anarchists for setting off a bomb. “Explosion Theory Favored by Expert,” reported the Boston Evening Globe. The trial that ensued lasted for years and gathered input from thousands of expert witnesses, producing 20,000 pages of conflicting testimony.  Ultimately, U.S. Industrial Alcohol, the company that owned the tank, was found liable, even as many questions remained about what had actually happened. More recent investigations suggest several fundamental problems with the structure of the tank. Designed to hold 2.5 million gallons of liquid, it measured 50 feet tall and 90 feet in diameter. But its steel walls, which ranged from 0.67 inches at the bottom to 0.31 inches at the top, were too thin to support the weight of a full tank of molasses, found a 2014 analysis by Ronald Mayville, a senior structural engineer in the Massachusetts consulting firm of Simpson, Gumpertz & Heger.  Flawed rivet design was another problem, according to Mayville’s analysis, and stresses were too high on the rivet holes, where cracks first formed. Although molasses had been poured into the container 29 times, only four of those refills were to near capacity. The fourth top off happened two days before the disaster, when a ship arrived from Puerto Rico carrying 2.3 million gallons of molasses. At that point, the tank held enough molasses to fill 3.5 Olympic sized swimming pools. Both the inadequate thickness and rivet issues were signs of negligence, and structural engineers knew better at the time, says Rossow. But the tank had been built quickly in the winter of 1915 to meet rising demand for industrial alcohol, which could be distilled from molasses and sold to weapons companies, who used it to make dynamite and other explosives for use during World War I.  And instead of inspecting the tank and filling it with water first to test it for flaws, USIA ignored all warning signs, including groaning noises every time it was filled. There were also obvious cracks. Before the tank blew, children would bring cups to fill with sweet molasses that dripped out of it.  “When a laborer brought actual shards of steel from the tank’s walls into the treasurer’s office as evidence of the potential danger,” Rossow wrote in a 2015 analysis, “he replied, ‘I don’t know what you want me to do. The tank still stands.’” What engineers didn’t know at the time, Rossow says, was that the steel had been mixed with too little manganese. That gave it a high transition temperature, making the metal brittle when it cooled below 59°F. The air temperature on the day of the disaster was about 40°F. Its brittleness might have been a final straw.  “There were a lot of culprits,” Rossow says. A similar flaw, he adds, befell some of the early Liberty ships built by the U.S. during World War II.  Welders carefully began cutting up the molasses tank with torches in the search for bodies five days after the flood. Even though firemen constantly sprayed water upon the twisted wreckage, it wasn't until the city ordered powerful streams from the city fireboat that the molasses began to disappear. The salt water of the harbor cut the molasses and eventually the welders could see the structure of the original tank to cut into it to find bodies. The Boston Globe/Getty Images Once the floodgates opened, the principles of fluid dynamics compounded the problem, says Nicole Sharp, an aerospace engineer in Denver, and author of FYFD, a fluid dynamics website. She became interested in the molasses flood after helping teach a class at Harvard University, in which a group of undergraduate students created a scaled model of the event. They released a vat of corn syrup into a tiny cardboard Boston, and used high speed cameras to film what happened. “I watched as the corn syrup engulfed tiny figurines,” Sharp says. “It would be like having a tsunami wave hit you. It made me want to look into the physics of the accident.”  She was particularly intrigued by reports of how fast the molasses flowed. Molasses, which is 1.5 times denser than water, is notoriously slow to pour. But in the flood, molasses—which is a non Newtonian fluid like ketchup or toothpaste—would have moved as a gravity current, much like a mudslide, avalanche or lava flow. Based on the features of molasses, Sharp’s calculations confirmed that the initial wave could have moved as quickly as 35 mph.  The day’s mild conditions probably aided the spread of molasses, which flowed outward for about two blocks. Conditions grew much worse that night as temperatures dropped, causing the liquid to become increasingly viscous.  Already pinned down by fallen buildings, some victims then became stuck in molasses. The liquid was a foot deep in some places. At least one person died by asphyxiation hours after the accident, Sharp says. Rescue efforts would have likely been easier, she speculates, if the accident had happened in the heat of July and the molasses had been able to spread further out from the tank.   There is plenty of science to explain what went wrong in the molasses flood. But the accident ultimately boils down to ethics, says Rossow, who has analyzed building collapses and other case studies to understand when engineering disasters are a result of negligence.  “Most of the things I’ve looked at don’t really have so much to do with lack of scientific knowledge so much as a lack of responsibility of the people in charge,” he says. “It’s an ethical issue, rather than understanding the science.”\n",

      "On 1 March, heavy rains struck Kandahar city, Zheri, Dand, Damand, Arghandab, Spinboldak, and Takhtapu Districts. In the last 30 hours, 97mm of rain fell in the affected areas. Flash floods triggered by the heavy rain have reportedly killed 20 people, including a number of children, when their homes collapsed or the vehicles they were traveling in were swept away. At least 10 people, including children, are still missing in Arghandab, Daman, Spin Boldak and Dand Districts. It is anticipated that up to 2,000 homes may have been damaged across all affected districts including Kandahar City.      As of 3 March, heavy rains have caused flooding in six provinces, Kandahar, Kunar, Zabul, Nimroz, Hirat and Farah. In Kandahar, more than 1,000 people stranded by the flood waters have been rescued by ANSF. Reports suggest that 85 per cent of Farah city has been flooded. . As of 4 March, eight provinces have been affected by heavy rains and flooding, according Government reports. More than 20 people are reported to have died as a result of the floods, including 13 people in Kandahar province. In excess of 1,600 houses have reportedly been damaged or destroyed, and there has been further damage water systems, agricultural land, schools, mosques and Government buildings. . As of 5 March, nine provinces have been affected by heavy rains and flooding, according Government reports. More than 40 people are known to have died, and hundreds of others have been injured or are missing. According to the Government, more than 2,500 houses have been damaged and over 1,300 destroyed. Flood affected people are in need of emergency shelter, warm clothing, food and hygiene kits.      In Kandahar province, some 21,200 people have been assessed requiring humanitarian assistance as a result of the floods. 25 people are known to have died and 40 people have been injured. According to joint assessments conducted by the government and humanitarian partners...in Kandahar and seven flood affected districts, 1,340 houses have been damaged and a further 1,276 have been destroyed.  As of 10 March, 33,000 people in Kandahar province have been identified as requiring humanitarian assistance following floods that struck the province at the beginning of March. According to assessments conducted by the Government and humanitarian partners, 2,800 houses have been damaged and 1,850 houses destroyed. Assessments are still ongoing in affected areas that are difficult to access due to insecurity. Humanitarian partners have so far provided 673 flood affected households with tents, NFIs including winter clothes, food assistance and hygiene kits. The Government has reportedly allocated 126 million Afghanis  for assistance including shelter repairs, agricultural assistance and food. Since 2 March, there has also been extensive flooding in Hilmand, Herat and Farah provinces, and humanitarian partners are continuing to conduct assessments and provide assistance in these areas.  Heavy rainfall has being affecting central, southern and western Afghanistan over the past two weeks, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The most affected provinces are Kandahar, Helmand, Farah, Herat and Badghis. According to ACAPS , as of 13 March, the death toll stands at 70, more than 8,670 houses have been damaged and approximately 250,000 people have been affected. Infrastructure damage, rugged terrain and the ongoing rainfall are hindering the response. Insecurity throughout the country remains high and may restrict operations. Nevertheless, the humanitarian response is being put in place to assist those affected with emergency shelter, food, non food items, winter clothes and emergency latrines. Over the next 72 hours, locally heavy rain and snowfall are forecast over Kabul area and north eastern areas of the country. Moderate rainfall and snowfall are forecast over the central areas of the country.  As of 19 March, more than 122,600 people across 14 provinces have been identified as being affected by the March floods and in need of humanitarian assistance. As a result of the floods, 63 people are known to have died and a further 31 people have been injured. The highest number of affected people are in Farah, where almost 52,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance. A further 32,750 people in Kandahar and 18,340 people in Hilmand also require assistance.  Heavy rains caused flash flooding on 27, 28 and 29 March in six provinces   Faryab, Balkh, Jawzjan, and Sar e Pul province in the Northern Region, and Hirat and Badghis in the Western Region. An estimated 17,000 people have been affected with Balkh and Hirat suffering the worst impacts. In Balkh, unconfirmed reports suggest several fatalities in Chemtal district, with up to 645 families  affected throughout the Province. In Hirat, Ministry of Health has reported that eight people died and nine were injured in six districts following flash flooding, while more than 1,000 families may have been affected. This new flooding adds to the impact of the overall flood emergency, with Farah and Kandahar the most effected to date. Since the beginning of 2019, more than 163,000 people have now been affected by floods, including those in the past week. A total of more than 42,000 people have been displaced.  After heavy rainfall that affected 22 out of the 34 Provinces of Afghanistan over the past few days, the death toll has risen to at least 16. According to media, as of 18 April at 8.00 UTC, in eastern Nangarhar Province, 11 people have died, six are injured and 266 houses were washed away, while in the western Province of Herat the death toll stands at five.  Unseasonal heavy rains and floods affected a number of regions of Afghanistan as well as Kabul, between 13 and 19 April. As of 22 April, 1,700 people have been affected with 16 people killed, 112 injured, and 250 houses damaged or destroyed due to flash floods. The floods have also damaged crops and infrastructure, including roads.  Afghan Red Crescent Society  teams carried out rapid needs assessments of flood affected areas on 1 9 March, and 10 14 April which showed mass destruction of houses and shelters, loss of lives, public facilities, mosques and displacements of people from their homes and IDPs camps due to the floods. It is anticipated that more rains shall fall in the coming months with little resources on the ground to respond to the needs of people in different provinces. The resilience of people in most of the provinces is already weak because of earlier protracted drought. There is a huge need in emergency shelter on the ground. Besides, there is continuous population movement from the rural villages to safer places with available humanitarian assistance and better basic services.  Heavy rainfall in recent days has triggered flash floods in a number of areas with Kabul, Parwan, Ghour, Herat, Bamyan and Ghazni most affected. According to media reports, as of 27 May at 8.00 UTC, 24 people have died, 11 are injured and 550 affected. 220 houses have been destroyed and 116 partially damaged. Over the past 24 hours, light to moderate rain is forecast in the northern part of the country.  Heavy rain affected several parts of Afghanistan over the past week, causing flash floods and triggering landslides. According to media reports, as of 11 June at 8.00 UTC, three people died and several houses have been destroyed after flash floods in Afghanistan.

More than 105,000 people have been displaced by flooding since late June, with people formerly displaced in Kachin, Rakhine and Chin states having already returned home when floodwaters receded.   Heavy rains are now severely affecting Mon State, with more than 7,000 people displaced in two days. According to the Myanmar Red Cross Society , there has been a landslide in Paung Township with houses buried and at least five reported deaths. Other townships have had houses and a school washed away, roads blocked and some towns and villages almost entirely flooded. MRCS is supporting the authorities with evacuations and transfers to hospital in the case of the landslide.   Kayin State and Bago region are also now especially hard hit, with more than 3,300 and 3,700 additional people displaced respectively in two days. MRCS, local governments, civil society organizations and NGOs have been involved in responding so far, including cash transfers, supplies of rice and non food items.

      "Annie Hall, a former county high sheriff, was swept away in Darley Dale early on Friday A woman who died after being swept away by floodwater was the former high sheriff of Derbyshire. Annie Hall’s body was found in the early hours of Friday after she was carried away in Darley Dale near Matlock. Hall served as the county’s high sheriff in 2017. “I am shocked and deeply saddened by the untimely and tragic death of my friend,” Derbyshire’s chief constable, Peter Goodman, said. “Annie was a great leader in Derbyshire in both industry and on the civic front. She will be hugely missed.” She was named as flood warnings remain in place across the Midlands and northern England as receding waters reveal a trail of devastation across the region. The Environment Agency has issued seven severe flood warnings for the River Don at Barnby Dun, Bently, Fishlake, Kirk Bramwith, Kirk Sandall, South Bramwith and Willow Bridge caravan site. “The River Don at Doncaster and the Derwent at Derby both peaked at record levels overnight,” said John Curtin, the EA’s executive director of flood and coastal risk management. “Although river levels are falling, dangerous flood waters remain.” There are also 55 warnings telling people to take immediate action in light of expected flooding, along with 88 alerts urging residents to be prepared. Derbyshire police said floodwaters were widespread on roads in Derby and across the county. Bus services have been disrupted and trains also delayed.  “If you come across a flooded road turn back and find a different route,” the force said on Twitter. “Even where water levels begin to lower the depth can still be unknown and cause significant danger. “As flood waters begin to recede you should take care not to come into contact with water or any of the silt or items left behind. Yorkshire and the Midlands were among the areas worst affected by heavy downpours on Thursday and Friday. Sheffield received 84mm of rain in 36 hours, close to the monthly average for Yorkshire, said the Met Office weather forecaster Marco Petanga. Gringley on the Hill in Nottinghamshire had 65mm of rain over the same time period. Dry weather and sunshine are now forecast for the areas worst affected by the floods. “It’s a cold start but there will be some sunshine throughout the day and a lot of dry weather,” Petanga said. There are two yellow rain warnings. One is in place from 11am to midnight stretching from Moreton in Marsh, Gloucestershire, to Eastbourne and Portsmouth, and another from 5am to 8pm covering Northern Ireland from Ballycastle to Newry. Up to 50mm of rain could fall in Northern Ireland on Saturday, Petanga said. The Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to visit South Yorkshire on Saturday, after the prime minister, Boris Johnson, angered people in the region on Friday by describing the floods as “not looking like something we need to escalate to the level of a national emergency”.\n",

      "Premier distances herself from decision to open Ross River dam floodgates, which sent water into Townsville suburbs  The Queensland government has announced an inquiry into the historic flooding in Townsville, as evidence mounts that local authorities failed to anticipate the extreme nature of the recent record rainfall. The independent inquiry will look into “key preparedness and response elements” to the storms that dumped more than one metre of rain on Townsville in less than a week. In the west of the state, graziers have been confronted with scenes described by one mayor as “hell”, as it became clear up to 300,000 cattle had died in the floods. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the sight so many cattle that had died agonising deaths made her “sick in the stomach”. The prime minister on Friday afternoon announced the grants to flood affected areas that were set at $25,000 on Thursday, had been raised to $75,000. Scott Morrison also said the commonwealth would provide an additional $3m to support mental health services in flood affected areas. “It will be a very, very difficult time. And while there are services in towns, those who are out in stations, those who are out dealing on the ground with their stock, who are dying in some of the most horrific circumstances, they will need our support,” he said. On Friday, Palaszczuk distanced her government from the decision to open the Ross River dam floodgates on Sunday night, which sent huge volumes of water into Townsville’s suburbs. Asked on Channel Seven’s Sunrise whether the gates should have been opened earlier to prevent some of the flooding, Palaszczuk said: “That’s a good question, you should direct that question to the Townsville city council, because they own that dam.” Guardian Australia revealed on Tuesday that Townsville council’s management of the dam was based on modelling designed to save properties in a one in 100 year flood. In more extreme events, the same strategy would be likely to cause more extensive damage. “You should direct that question to the Townsville City Council”@AnnastaciaMP deflects responsibility for the controversial decision to delay opening the Townsville dam during the flood disaster. pic.twitter.com/WxGVrWBmyl On Friday, the mayor of Townsville, Jenny Hill, told the Townsville Bulletin that some rainfall readings were at levels probably recorded once every 2,000 years. “A team of experts is analysing the data, but it is clear the flood levels in the Ross River were greater than a one in 500 years event,” Hill said. “There were rainfall totals over the Ross River dam catchment that were in excess of one in 2,000 years rainfall event.” The decision to open the floodgates on Sunday night, when the dam water level reached 43 metres, was in line with the dam’s management plan, and based on a 2012 study that also assessed the impact of opening the spillway earlier. It said waiting until 43 metres would save about 960 homes in a one in 100 year flood. But doing so would cause greater property damage – affecting about 600 more properties – in the sort of situation that faced Townsville this week. When the gates were opened fully on Sunday night, so much water had built up that 1,900 cubic metres of water per second spilled into the Ross River. The release was the direct cause of much of the flooding experienced in low lying Townsville suburbs. The impact was felt most severely at Idalia, where properties had been built mostly during the past two decades, and which were considered to be effectively free of the risk of flooding. Planning decisions are based on whether properties would be inundated during a one in 100 year flood. Many residents in that area told Guardian Australia they believed their properties, mostly built on concrete slabs without flood mitigation measures, were not at risk. Professor Jamie Pittock of the Australian National University said authorities in Australia typically made planning and flood management decisions based on the “one in 100” year designation. In Europe and the United States, contingencies are made for more extreme natural disasters. “We’re creating trouble by not planning for those ,” Pittock said. “What today is the one in 100 year flood, in five years’ time it could well be the one in 50 year flood.” Meanwhile in western Queensland, the floodwaters have killed up to 300,000 head of cattle, and the losses have been put at a staggering $300m. The mayor of Richmond, John Wharton, said there had been huge stock losses in his area, as well as McKinlay shire, and parts of Flinders and Cloncurry shires. The rural lobby group AgForce warned that thousands more cattle could be dead by the weekend unless emergency fodder shipments reached them immediately. “This is a disaster,” Wharton said. “Cattle just couldn’t move, the water just kept rising and rising and the water broke its banks. “There are railway lines washed away, the roads are buggered and there is a lot of cattle gone. They could not survive. It was just hell.” Palaszczuk has toured the flood hit Cloncurry area, and at times stumbled over her words as she struggled to describe what she had witnessed. “We went along a road with the mayor for about 20 minutes and to the right of me was a sea of dead cattle,” she said on ABC radio. “To see the cattle spread across these yards, not moving ... it made you feel sick in the stomach. It’s really hard for words to describe it.” She said it was clear many animals had endured agonising deaths and the confronting scenes demonstrated the level of help graziers would need to recover. “These cattle producers have gone through an extended period of drought and they’ve come smack bang into a natural disaster.” Wharton said many farmers had run down their herds to survive years of crippling drought and now faced devastation. “There are a lot of broken hearted people,” he said. “Emotionally, they are not doing real well.”\n",
